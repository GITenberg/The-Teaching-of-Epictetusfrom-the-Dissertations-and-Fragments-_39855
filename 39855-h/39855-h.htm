<h4>INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p>But for the zeal and ability of one disciple
we should not now possess any trustworthy
account of the teaching of Epictetus. For,
like not a few other sages, he wrote nothing&mdash;his
teaching was purely oral, delivered,
in the form of lectures or discourses, to the
students who came to him to receive their
education in philosophy. One of these
students was Flavius Arrianus, afterwards
Senator and Consul of Rome, named by
Lucian &#8220;one among the first of Roman
men,&#8221; and known to us chiefly as author of
the best history of Alexander the Great
which was produced in antiquity. That
history is still extant, but posterity owes
Arrian still more abundant thanks for the
copious notes of the teaching of Epictetus
which he took down from his master&#8217;s lips
in Nicopolis. This record he afterwards
published in eight books (whereof only four
now remain), entitled the <i>Dissertations of
Epictetus</i>; and out of these he drew the
materials for compiling the little work, the
<i>Encheiridion</i>, or Manual, of Epictetus, by
which this philosopher has hitherto been
most generally known.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p>It is clear that the <i>Dissertations</i> were not
regarded by Arrian as a satisfactory representation
of the teaching of his master;
that he published them, indeed, with much
reluctance, and only when it appeared that
unless he did so, certain imperfect versions
of his records would be established as the
sole sources of authoritative information
about Epictetus. These circumstances are
explained in a dedicatory letter to his friend
Lucius Gellius, prefixed to the edition of the
<i>Dissertations</i> which Arrian finally resolved
to issue. I here translate this document in
full:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrian to Lucius Gellius, hail.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not write [in literary form and
composition, &#963;&#965;&#947;&#947;&#961;&#8049;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#957;] the words of Epictetus
in the manner in which a man might
write such things. Neither have I put them
forth among men, since, as I say, I did not
even write them. But whatever I heard
him speak, those things I endeavored to
set down in his very words, so to preserve
to myself for future times a memorial of his
thought and unstudied speech. Naturally,
therefore, they are such things as one man
might say to another on the occasion of the
moment, not such as he would put together
with the idea of finding readers long afterwards.
Such they are, and I know not
how without my will or knowledge they
fell among men. But to me it is no great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
matter if I shall appear unequal to composing
such a work, and to Epictetus none at
all if any one shall despise his discourse; for
when he spoke it, it was evident that he had
but one aim&mdash;to stir the minds of his hearers
towards the best things. And if, indeed, the
words here written should do the same, then
they will do, I think, that which the words
of sages ought to do. But if not, yet let
those who read them know this, that when
he himself spoke them, it was impossible for
the hearer to avoid feeling whatever Epictetus
desired he should feel. But if his words, when
they are merely words, have not this
effect, perhaps it is that I am in fault, perhaps
it could not have been otherwise.
Farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>The style of the <i>Dissertations</i>, as they have
reached us, answers very well to the above
account of their origin and purpose. They
contain much that the world should be as
little willing to neglect as anything that
Greek philosophy has left us; but they
contain also many repetitions, redundancies,
incoherencies; and are absolutely devoid of
any sort of order or system in their arrangement.
Each chapter has generally something
of a central theme, but beyond this
all is chaos. The same theme will be dwelt
on again and again in almost the same
phrases; utterances of majestic wisdom are
imbedded in pages of tedious argument,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
and any grouping of the chapters according
to a progressive sequence of ideas will be
looked for in vain.</p>

<p>Under these conditions it was evident
that the teaching of Epictetus could never
win half the influence which its essential
qualities fitted it to exercise. And accordingly,
as another and better vehicle for this
influence, Arrian compiled and condensed
from the <i>Dissertations</i> the small handbook of
the Stoic philosophy known as the <i>Encheiridion
of Epictetus</i>. This little work has made
Epictetus known to very many whom the
<i>Dissertations</i> would never have reached. It
had the distinction&mdash;unparalleled in the case
of any other Pagan writing, if we except
the doubtful <i>Sententi&aelig;</i> of Xystus&mdash;of being
adopted as a religious work in the early
Christian Church. Two paraphrases of it&mdash;still
extant&mdash;one of which was specially designed
for the use of monastic bodies, were
produced about the sixth century <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>, in
which very few changes were made in the
text, beyond the alteration of Pagan names
and allusions to Scriptural ones.</p>

<p>About the same time it was made the subject
of an elaborate and lengthy commentary
by a Pagan writer, Simplicius, wherein
chapter after chapter is dissected, discussed,
and explained. It was elegantly rendered
into Latin by the well-known scholar of the
Renaissance, Angelo Politian, who dedicated
his translation to Lorenzo de&#8217; Medici. Down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
to the present day, as numerous translations
testify, it has remained the most usual means
of access to the thought of Epictetus.</p>

<p>But inestimable as the <i>Encheiridion</i> is, he
who knows it alone has gained nothing like
all that Epictetus has to give. It is a compendium;
and although much more stirring
and forcible than is usual with such works,
it cannot give us the wealth of interesting
allusion, reflection, humor, the bursts of
eloquence, the abrupt and biting style, the
vivid revelations of personal feeling, which
marked the teaching of Epictetus in the form
in which he delivered it. It seems, therefore,
that to make him as accessible as he
can be to those for whom such things have
any value or interest, it were necessary to
produce from the <i>Encheiridion</i> and the <i>Dissertations</i>
a third work, which should have
the advantages of each. This is what I
have endeavored to do in the present work.
In it the whole of the <i>Encheiridion</i> is given,
and the divisions of subject-matter into
which the <i>Encheiridion</i> falls have been observed
by the division of my translation into
five Books, corresponding with the natural
divisions of the <i>Encheiridion</i>&mdash;Book I., treating
of the first principles of the Stoic philosophy;
Book II., dealing with the general
application of these principles to life; Book
III., with man&#8217;s relations to his fellow-man;
Book IV., with his relations to God; Book
V., containing, besides a couple of concluding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
chapters, chiefly practical counsels of
behavior on various particular occasions,
and <i>obiter dicta</i> on the use of the faculties.
Such is the scheme of arrangement suggested
by the <i>Encheiridion</i>; and I have filled it in
by setting among the chapters of the <i>Encheiridion</i>
chapters or passages from the <i>Dissertations</i>,
selected for their relevancy to the
matter in hand. In fact, I have reversed
the process by which the <i>Encheiridion</i> came
into being. It was condensed out of the
<i>Dissertations</i>: I have expanded it again by
drawing into it a large quantity of material
from the original work, and subjecting the
new matter thus gained to the system and
order of sequence which I found to prevail
in the <i>Encheiridion</i>. The passages or chapters
taken from the <i>Dissertations</i> are those
which seemed to me most characteristic of
the philosophy or the personality of Epictetus,
and I have made it my aim to omit
nothing which is essential to a full and clear
understanding of the message he had to deliver
to his generation. Of course there is
plenty of room for differences of opinion as
to the manner in which this conception has
been here carried out; but I hope that the
present attempt may do something to win a
larger audience for his teaching than former
editions could, in the nature of the case,
obtain. If this hope should prove to be well
founded, I shall expect, some day, to give
the present English version a counterpart
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
in a Greek text arranged on the same
lines.</p>

<p>I may add here that the reader will find
an Index at the end of this volume, in which
every paragraph is referred to its original
source in the <i>Dissertations</i>, <i>Encheiridion</i>, or
<i>Fragments</i>&mdash;the references applying to
Schweigh&auml;user&#8217;s standard edition of Epictetus.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>As regards the style of my translation, I
hope the tinge of archaism I have given it
will be felt to suit the matter. I could think
of no idiom so varied, so flexible even down
to its use of various grammatical forms, so
well suited alike to colloquy, or argument,
or satire, or impassioned eloquence, as Elizabethan
English.</p>

<p>So much to make the plan of the present
work understood; and the reader may perhaps
wish that I would now leave him to
the study of it. But there is much in Epictetus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
the significance of which will not appear
to any one who is unacquainted with the
general system of Stoic philosophy which
formed the basis of Epictetus&#8217;s ethical teaching.
And I hope that the reader will prefer
to have such information as is necessary
given him in the form of a general introduction
rather than in that of a multitude of
notes.</p>

<p>The founder of the Stoic philosophy was
Zeno, a native of Cyprus, who taught in
Athens, about 300 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, in that frescoed
arcade, or Stoa, which gave its name to his
school. His birthplace is worth noting, for
Zeno lived at the beginning of that epoch,
himself one of the first products of it, in
which the influence of the East became
strongly apparent in Greek thought; the
period called Hellenistic in contradistinction
to the purely Hellenic period which ended
in the conquests of the Macedonians. In
many ways the conditions of life in the
Hellenistic period formed the most favorable
<i>milieu</i> possible for the development of Greek
thought upon the only lines which, after
Aristotle, it could fruitfully pursue; and this
not in spite of, but even because of, the
great degradation of political and social life
from which all Hellendom then suffered.
What the democratic polities were like, on
which was laid the problem of confronting
Philip of Macedon, we may conjecture from
the history of the best known and assuredly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
not the worst of them, Athens. And the
best type of Athenian whose rise to power
was favored by the conditions of this time
and place was Demosthenes: Demosthenes,
the grand historical warning to all peoples
against committing their destinies to professional
orators; the statesman whose doubtless
real veneration for his country and her
past served only to make him a more mischievous
counselor in her present difficulties;
whose splendid power as a wielder of
words was scarcely more signal than his
incapacity and cowardice when he was
called upon to match those words with deeds.
Athens, entangling the Thebans in an alliance
against Macedon, and then leaving
them to face Alexander alone; deifying Demetrius
the Besieger for driving out a Macedonian
garrison, and allotting him the
Parthenon itself to be his lodging and the
scene of his unspeakable profligacies; murdering
Phocion, the one man who dared to
bring sincerity and virtue to her service&mdash;Athens
was a type of the Greek States of
this epoch: too unprincipled for democratic
government, too contentious for despotism,
too vain to submit to foreign rule, too lacking
in valor, purpose, union, to resist it with
effect.</p>

<p>Whatever the causes of the change may
have been, the conditions of public life in
this Hellenistic period were certainly very
different from those which prevailed, albeit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
with decadence, before that vast breaking
up of boundaries and destruction of political
systems involved in the Macedonian conquests.
The successful and inspiring conflict
with Persia waged by the Hellenic States
had for a time made all Greek hearts to beat
with one aspiration, and had brought to the
front a race of leaders who were capable of
subduing the Greek democracies to their own
steadfast and statesmanlike purposes. Public
life was then not only a possible but
even the most natural career for a man of
talent and probity. The small size of the
Greek States gave almost every such man
an opportunity of action, and so keen and
universal was the interest in politics that it
threatened to lead Greek philosophy into a
region in which philosophy is very apt to
lose its vitalizing connection with human
consciousness and experience, and to stiffen
into barren speculation. In a word, man,
as an individual, began to be too much lost
sight of in the consideration of man as a
citizen; his uses, his duties, the whole worth
and significance of his life, came to be estimated
too exclusively by his relations to
the visible society about him. It was when
the great Stoic Chrysippus found himself
obliged to stand aloof from all participation
in politics&mdash;&#8220;For if I counsel honorably I
shall offend the citizens, and if basely, the
Gods&#8221;&mdash;that such men as he were led to
ask themselves: Is there then any sphere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
of human endeavor out of the reach of the
tyranny of circumstance? If I cannot be a
citizen, what am I worth then simply as a
man? If I can be nothing to my fellows,
what can I be to God? To a state of things,
then, which, speaking broadly, made public
life impossible to honest men, we owe the
noblest ethical system of antiquity; to the
enforced concentration of thought upon the
individual we owe a certain note of universality
till then absent from Hellenic thought.</p>

<p>But stoicism was not the only product of
the speculation of this period. Side by side
with it there started into being two other
systems of philosophy, the necessity for
combating which was doubtless of immense
service to its development. These were
Epicureanism and Pyrrhonism; and as the
reader will find Epictetus much concerned
with each of them, it may be desirable that I
should give some brief account of their cardinal
doctrines.</p>

<p>Epicurus was an Athenian. After some
residence in Lesbos and Lampsacus, he began
to teach in his native city about the year
306 B.C. His ethical views, which are all
that concern us here, were of a distinctly
unelevating nature. Pleasure, &#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#8053;, was
pronounced to be for each man the end and
aim of his being, and the only rational motive
of action. This, however, was not the
pleasure of the voluptuary&mdash;its highest forms,
according to Epicurus, were gained in &#7936;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#958;&#8055;&#945;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
and &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#945;&mdash;that is, a cheerful and unanxious
temperament, with leisure for contemplation,
ends not attainable by the criminal who lives
in constant fear of detection, or the luxurious
liver in whom satiety produces disgust
and weariness.</p>

<p>Certain bodily conditions were, however,
regarded as objects in themselves, and partaking
of the nature of the absolutely good;
and all entanglement in human relationships
was discountenanced for the disturbance
and distress which such relationships
were liable to cause. These doctrines were
put in practice by their teacher in inuring
himself to a hermit-like simplicity and abstemiousness
of life; and his life was philosophically
consistent with his doctrines, for
it is clear that the end of Pleasure will be
most surely gained by him who has fewest
wants to gratify. But though the lives of
Epicurus and his immediate followers were
exceptionally sober and strict, the total effect
of his doctrine could not but have been evil.
They were purely egoistic in this tendency&mdash;they
centered each man&#8217;s activity and interest
upon himself alone, they bade him
take no thought for any other earthly or
heavenly thing, and taught him that this
ideal of indifference was realized in its full
perfection by the Gods, who dwelt apart in
divine repose while blind necessity had its
way with human destiny.</p>

<p>Pyrrho of Elis, a rather earlier teacher
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
than Zeno or Epicurus, who is said to have
studied philosophy under Indian Gymnosophists
and Chaldean Magi, was the originator
in European thought of a great and permanent
philosophic movement. His school
was inspired by the <i>Geist der stets verneint</i>, and
the term Skeptic was first devised to describe
its attitude. Its strength is in a discovery
which inevitably takes place when men
begin to reflect upon their own mental operations&mdash;the
discovery, namely, that, given a
perceiving mind and a perceived object, it
is always possible for the former, if it has
the power of introspection, to doubt whether
it has received a really true and faithful impression
of the latter. How can we be
assured that external objects are as we perceive
them? How can we even be assured
that there is any principle of constancy in
their relations to our consciousness? The
senses often delude us; we are convinced,
in dreams, of the reality of appearances
which, nevertheless, have no reality&mdash;-why
may not all perception be a delusion? Why
may not even our sense of the validity of inference
and of the truth of the axioms of
geometry be a pure hallucination? With
these searching questions the Skeptic cut at
the root of all belief, and the problems which
they raise have dominated philosophy down
to the present day. Nor in two thousand
years has any logical answer to them ever
been found. Lotze, the last thinker of really
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
first-rate powers that the world has seen,
practically abandons all inquiry into theories
of perception, and starts with the <i>assumption</i>
that we are living in a kosmos, not a
chaos; that the order, coherence, reason in
things to which consciousness testifies, are
realities. In antiquity, I may add, the profound
problems raised by Pyrrhonism do not
seem to have been very profoundly apprehended
either by the Pyrrhonists or their
opponents. The latter had nothing better
to appeal to than that notoriously feeble resource,
the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>. If the
Pyrrhonist distrusted the evidence of his
senses, they asked, why did he avoid walking
over precipices or into the sea, or eat bread
instead of earth, or in any way make choice
of means for ends? The Pyrrhonist&#8217;s answer
was equally superficial. It anticipated the
famous formula of Bishop Butler. Probability,
argued they, was the guide of life&mdash;having
observed certain results to follow
from certain antecedents, the prudent man
will shape his course in life accordingly, although,
as a matter of theory and speculation,
he may refuse to believe in the constancy
of nature. This answer involves a clear
inconsistency. It involves even a greater
assumption than that which the Pyrrhonist
refused to make as to the credibility of his
perceptions&mdash;the assumption of the credibility
of his recollections. To the thorough-going
Skeptic there is no such thing as past
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
experience&mdash;he is, as it were, new-born at
each instant of his life.</p>

<p>Such, in outline, were the systems against
which the Stoic philosophy had to make
good its position in the ancient world. From
the first there seems to have been no doubt
of its ability to do so, although, unhappily,
the records which have been preserved of
the teaching of its earliest days are few and
obscure. The writings of Zeno, the founder
of Stoicism, and of Chrysippus, his immediate
successor in the leadership of the school,
have utterly perished, while of Cleanthes,
the third of the early Stoic teachers, very
little remains beyond the profound and majestic
Hymn to Zeus, of which I have given
a translation in this work. The complete
loss of the hundreds of treatises produced by
Chrysippus is especially to be regretted, as
he appears to have taken the main part in
giving shape and system to the Stoic philosophy.
&#8220;Had Chrysippus not been, the Stoa
had not been,&#8221; was a proverbial saying
which testifies to his fame. However, from
the accounts of ancient philosophers in
Diogenes Laertius, from Plutarch, Seneca,
Cicero, and a few other authorities, we can
learn pretty clearly what the framework of
the Stoic system had grown to be long before
Epictetus began to study it.</p>

<p>In antiquity, a philosophic system was
expected to have something to say for itself
on three different branches of study&mdash;Logic,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Physics (which included cosmogony and
theology), and Ethics. We think of the
Stoics chiefly in connection with the last-named
of these subjects, but they were no
less eminent in the others, and Chrysippus,
in particular, was held to have done so much
for the science of logic that a saying was
current&mdash;&#8220;If there were dialectic among the
Gods, it must be the dialectic of Chrysippus.&#8221;
Of the Stoic contributions to this science,
scarcely any record remains.</p>

<p>Of their physical system, however, much
is known, and the reader of Epictetus needs
to be acquainted with its general features.
These were borrowed from an earlier thinker,
Heracleitus, whose central doctrine was
that the universe was an eternal flux and
transition; everything was in a state of becoming,
<i>ein Werdendes</i>. At the beginning
of things, so far as they can be said to have
any beginning, is the Deity in his purest
manifestation, which, be it observed, is a
strictly material one, a sublimated and
ethereal fire, &#945;&#7984;&#952;&#949;&#961;&#8182;&#948;&#949;&#962; &#960;&#8166;&#961;. In this fire dwelt
the divine creative thought and impulse.
The first step in that process of differentiation
in which development consists is the
production of vapor, which condensed into
water. Two elementary forces play their
part in these operations&mdash;a movement towards
within, and a movement towards
without, the one a densifying, the other
an expanding and straining force (&#964;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;).
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
The former gives us solidity in matter, the
other the qualities and energies of matter.
Thus, by various degrees of density, we get
earth, water, atmospheric air, and from air,
the common element of earthly fire; and
these elements in their various combinations,
with their various attributes and
powers, gradually produce the successive
stages of organic life. Though all these proceed
from the substance of the Divine Being,
the Stoics recognized, in the derived substance
which make up the universe as we
have it now, various degrees of purity, of
affinity to their original source. Man&#8217;s body,
for instance, with its passions and affections,
lies comparatively far from the divine; but
his soul is a veritable ray of the primitive
fire, <i>Deus in corpore humano hospitans</i>. The
popular mythology of the day was entirely
rejected by the Stoics, although, as Professor
Mahaffy points out, they never attempted
to &#8220;discredit orthodoxy,&#8221; but, on the contrary,
used its myths and ceremonies with
the utmost reverence as vehicles of profound
religious truths. But they certainly believed
in intelligences above man, yet below the one
Supreme Being; thus the stars and the lightning
(the reader will observe the allusions in
the Hymn of Cleanthes) are in some sense
divinities, by virtue of the supposed purity
of their fiery essence.</p>

<p>Thus from the one primitive divine element
the Kosmos, with all its hierarchy of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
being, is evolved. But in the Stoic system
&#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#8165;&#949;&#8150;,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> there is no continuance in any one
condition. As in the normal life of all
earthly creatures there comes a certain
climax or turning point, after which the
forces of decay gain slowly but surely on
those of growth and resistance, so also runs
the history of the universe which includes
them all. One by one the steps by which
it was formed shall be retraced, and the
derived substances which compose it consumed
and re-absorbed by that from which
they sprang. From matter in its grossest
form to its purest, from earth and stone and
water to the highest intelligence in men and
d&aelig;mons and Gods, nothing shall escape this
doom of dissolution; everything shall yield
up its separate existence, until at last the
indestructible element of that primeval fire
is again the sole being that remains, and
Zeus is &#8220;alone in the conflagration,&#8221; self-contemplating
in the solitudes of thought.
But this is not the end. There is no end.
The plastic impulse again resumes its sway,
and soon another cycle of world-development
and world-destruction begins to run
its course. In the language of Seneca,
&#8220;When that fatal day, that necessity of the
times, shall have arrived, and it seems good
to God to make an end of old things and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
ordain the better, then shall the ancient
order be revoked and every creature be
generated anew, and a race ignorant of guilt
be given to the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the general physical system on
which all Stoics were agreed, although there
were differences of opinion upon minor
points; such as how far these successive
cycles resembled each other? some asserting
that they did so in the minutest detail,
others only in their larger features. It was
a system, for all its superstitions, not without
grandeur and truth. At bottom it expressed
a sense of that phenomenon of ebb
and flow, systole and diastole, the action
and counteraction of balanced forces, which
is perhaps the profoundest law of life.</p>

<p>Two questions arise in connection with
the Stoic cosmogony, which we must briefly
discuss before proceeding farther. Are we
justified in terming their view of the universe
a materialistic one? and what was their
doctrine of the destinies of the human soul?
Now it is certainly the usual practice among
writers on philosophy to reckon the Stoics
as materialists, and it is unquestionably true
that they denied the possibility of any existence
which was not corporeal. Strong as
they are on the supremacy of the human
soul over the human body, sharp as is the
line with which they divide these elements,
yet the distinction is a moral, not a metaphysical
one&mdash;each is an actual material substance.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
But we shall be seriously mistaken,
nevertheless, if we place them in the same
class with the scientific materialists of
the present day. According to the latter,
Thought is no necessary moment in the
universe, but merely a product of certain accidental
combinations of matter, a product
which, when these are dissolved, must disappear
from existence, without leaving a
trace of its presence behind. Again, according
to most modern opponents of the materialistic
view, Thought has an independent
and immortal being&mdash;it existed before matter
was, and would continue to exist if all matter
were annihilated. The Stoic view differed
from each of these modern theories. It held
Thought and Matter to be eternal, inseparable,
and, indeed, strictly identical. Being
in its primitive and purest form was fire, a
corporeal substance, but one exhibiting consciousness,
purpose, will.</p>

<p>As to the question of the Stoic view of the
immortality of the human soul, it does not
seem to me to deserve so much discussion
as it has received from some commentators.
It is obvious that the soul must, in the end,
share the lot of all other existences, and be
resolved into the Divine Being which was its
source. The only question that can arise is
whether this resolution takes place at the
moment of death, or whether the sense of
personal identity persists for a certain period
beyond that event; and this question, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Epictetus appears to have been wise enough
to leave an open one, is philosophically of
very little importance. The soul is immortal,
the individual perishes; this is the conclusion
of Stoicism, and if we know this,
there is little else it can much concern us to
know.</p>

<p>The reader who desires to gain a thorough
knowledge of Hellenistic philosophy, and of
the social and political conditions in which
it throve, will find what he seeks in two
works to which I have to express my large
indebtedness. One is Zeller&#8217;s <i>Philosophie
der Griechen</i> (<i>Epikureer</i>, <i>Stoiker u. Skeptiker</i>),<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
a monument of German research and erudition,
in which vast masses of original material
for the study of this most interesting,
but neglected, epoch of the development
of European intellect have been brought
together, and interpreted with more than
German lucidity and method. The other is
Professor Mahaffy&#8217;s recent volume, <i>Greek Life
and Thought</i>, a study of the Hellenistic period
in various aspects, which the scholar will
not read without profit, nor the lay-reader
without pleasure.</p>

<p>We turn now to that department of the
Stoic philosophy with which the reader of
Epictetus is most concerned&mdash;its Ethics.</p>

<p>The ethical question resolves itself into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
a search for the supreme object of human
endeavor, the <i>Summum Bonum</i>, the absolute
and essential good. This, for the Stoic,
embodied itself in the formula, &#8220;to live
according to Nature.&#8221; But what is Nature?
The will of God, as revealed in the heart and
conscience of those who seek to know it,
and interpreted through the observation in a
reverent and faithful spirit of the facts of
life.</p>

<p>Going into the subject more precisely we
find certain criteria of moral truth established,
&#960;&#961;&#959;&#955;&#8053;&#968;&#949;&#953;&#962;, as they were called, that
is, primitive, original conceptions, or, as I
have rendered them in my translation, &#8220;natural
conceptions,&#8221; dogmas by which all
moral questions can be tried. If we inquire
into the source of these &#960;&#961;&#959;&#955;&#8053;&#968;&#949;&#953;&#962;, we shall
find ourselves mistaken in our disposition
to think that the Stoics regarded them as
innate ideas. Innate they are not, for the
Stoics held the soul at birth to be a <i>tabula rasa</i>,
or blank page, which only experience could
fill with character and meaning. But as
Seneca says in his inquiry, &#8220;Quomodo ad
nos prima boni honestique notitia pervenerit,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
although Nature alone could not
teach us these things, could not equip us with
the knowledge of them before we entered
upon life, yet the &#8220;seeds&#8221; of this knowledge
she does give us; the soul of every man has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
implanted in it a certain aptness or, indeed,
necessity to deduce certain universal truths
from such observation and experience as are
common to all mankind; and these truths,
the &#960;&#961;&#959;&#955;&#8053;&#968;&#949;&#953;&#962;, though not strictly innate, have
thus an inevitableness and dogmatic force not
possessed by those which one man may
reach and another miss in the exercise of
the ordinary faculties, by argument, study,
and so forth. By these natural conceptions
the existence and character of God, and the
general decrees of the moral law, are considered
to be affirmed. If we inquire further
how the Stoic explained the fact that some
of these so-called inevitable and universal
conclusions are denied in all sincerity by
men like Epicurus, who were neither bad
nor mad, we strike upon the difficulty which
confronts all systems that aim at setting up
any absolute body of truth, expressible in
human language, in place of that partial,
progressive, and infinitely varied revelation
of God&#8217;s mind and purpose to which the
uncolored facts of the world&#8217;s religious
history seem to testify.</p>

<p>The natural conceptions, as I have said,
contain the primary doctrines of ethics.
None of these are more important for the
Stoic than that which declares essential
Good to lie in the active, not the passive
side of man; in the will, not in the flesh,
nor in anything else which the will is unable
to control. But a certain relative and conditional
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
goodness may lie in matters which
are yet of no moment to the spiritual man,
to that part of him which seeks the essential
good. And we must note that when
Epictetus speaks of certain things as good
or bad or indifferent, he is generally speaking
of them in their relation to the spiritual
man, and in the most absolute and unconditional
sense. No evil can happen to the
essential part of man, to that side of him
which is related to the eternal and divine,
without his own will. Hence the death of a
beloved friend, or child, or wife, is no evil;
and if it be no evil, we are forbidden to
grieve for it, or, in the most usual phrase
with Epictetus, we are not to be troubled or
confounded by it, &#964;&#945;&#961;&#8049;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;. But if this
utterance should shock our natural feelings,
it will do something which assuredly Epictetus
never meant it to do. It is the soul of
man which these events cannot injure, and
it is the soul which is forbidden to think
itself injured by them. Such love of the
individual as may be embraced in the larger
love of the All, of God&mdash;such grief for
bereavements and calamities as does not
overwhelm the inner man (ii. 19) in a
&#8220;wave of mortal tumult,&#8221; and dull his vital
sense of the great moral ends which he was
born to pursue, is repeatedly and explicitly
admitted by Epictetus. Thus, in iii. 2, we
have him arguing against Epicurus that
there are certain natural sympathies between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
man and his kind, and even convicting
Epicurus himself of a secret belief in these
sympathies. Epicurus had dissuaded his
followers from marriage, and the bringing-up
of children, on account of the grief and anxiety
which such relations necessarily entail.
Not so the Stoics&mdash;they pressed their disciples
to enter into the ordinary earthly relationships
of husband, or wife, or citizen, and
this without pretending to have found any
means of averting the natural consequences
which Epicurus dreaded, although they did
profess to have discovered something in
man which made him equal to the endurance
of them. Again, although the condition
of &#7936;&#960;&#8049;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;, of inward peace, of freedom
from passions, is again and again represented
by Epictetus as the mark of the
perfect sage, we are told that this &#7936;&#960;&#8049;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945; is
something quite different from &#8220;apathy&#8221;&mdash;a
man is not to be emotionless &#8220;like a
statue.&#8221; And a third passage confirming
this view is to be found in Book I., ch. xi.
(Schweigh&auml;user), where the conduct of a
man who was so afflicted by the illness of
his little daughter that he ran away from
the house, and would hear news of her only
through messages, is condemned, not for
the affection and anxiety it proved, but for
its utter unreasonableness. &#8220;Would you,&#8221;
asks Epictetus, &#8220;have her mother and her
nurse and her pedagogue, who all love her
too, also run away from her, and leave her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
to die in the hands of persons who neither
love nor care for her at all?&#8221; There is a
grief which is really a self-indulgence, a
barren, absorbing, paralyzing grief, which, to
the soul possessed by it, makes every other
thing in heaven and earth seem strange and
cold and trivial. From such grief alone
Epictetus would deliver us, and I think he
would have accepted Mr. Aubrey de Vere&#8217;s
noble sonnet on <i>Sorrow</i> as a thoroughly
fit poetic statement of Stoic doctrine on this
subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;Count each affliction, whether light or grave,</span>
<span class="i0">God&#8217;s messenger sent down to thee; do thou</span>
<span class="i0">With courtesy receive him; rise and bow;</span>
<span class="i0">And, ere his shadow pass thy threshold, crave</span>
<span class="i0">Permission first his heavenly feet to lave;</span>
<span class="i0">Then lay before him all thou hast, allow</span>
<span class="i0">No cloud of passion to usurp thy brow,</span>
<span class="i0">Or mar thy hospitality; no wave</span>
<span class="i0">Of mortal tumult to obliterate</span>
<span class="i0">The soul&#8217;s marmoreal calmness: Grief should be</span>
<span class="i0">Like joy, majestic, equable, sedate,</span>
<span class="i0">Confirming, cleansing, raising, making free,</span>
<span class="i0">Strong to consume small troubles; to commend</span>
<span class="i0">Great thoughts, grave thoughts, thoughts lasting to the end.&#8221;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the grief that shall do this is a grief
that must be <i>felt</i>. And Epictetus assuredly
never meant to offer the Stoic philosophy as
a mere stupefying anodyne. Make the man
a Stoic, and something yet remains to do&mdash;to
make the Stoic a man. One of these purposes
was not more the concern of Epictetus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
than the other. And he pursued both of
them with a strength, sincerity, and sanity
of thought, with a power of nourishing the
heroic fiber in humanity, which, to my
mind, make him the very chief of Pagan
moralists.</p>

<p>It is no purpose of mine to fill this preface
with information which the reader can gain
without doubt or difficulty from the author
whom it introduces, and therefore I shall
leave him to discover for himself what the
positive ethical teaching of Epictetus was
like. Nor is it, unhappily, possible to say
much upon another subject on which Epictetus
gives us little or no information&mdash;his
own life and circumstances. Arrian wrote
a biography of him, but it is now entirely
lost, and the biographical details which have
been collected from Simplicius, Suidas,
Aulus Gellius, and others are very scanty.
He was born at Hierapolis, in Phrygia, and
became, how is unknown, a slave of
Epaphroditus, a freedman and favorite of
Nero, who is recorded to have treated him
with great cruelty. One day, it is said,
Epaphroditus began twisting his leg for
amusement. Epictetus said, &#8220;If you go on
you will break my leg.&#8221; Epaphroditus persisted,
the leg was broken, and Epictetus,
with unruffled serenity, only said, &#8220;Did I
not tell you that you would break my leg?&#8221;
This circumstance is adduced by Celsus in
his famous controversy with Origen as an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
instance of Pagan fortitude equal to anything
which Christian martyrology had to show;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
but it is probably a mere myth which grew
up to account for the fact mentioned by
Simplicius and Suidas that Epictetus was
feeble in body and lame from an early age.</p>

<p>Epaphroditus was probably a very bad
master, and as a favorite and intimate of
Nero&#8217;s must have been a bad man; but we
have to thank him for the fact that Epictetus,
while yet a slave, was sent to attend the
philosophic lectures of Musonius Rufus, an
eminent Stoic of Rome, whom both Epictetus
and Marcus Aurelius mention with
great respect. The system of philosophic
training had been at this time long organized.
There were masters of repute everywhere,
who delivered their instruction in
regular courses, received a fixed payment for
the same, and under whom crowds of young
men assembled from far and near to study
science and ethics&mdash;to receive, in short,
what corresponded to a university education
in those days. The curious circumstance
that a slave like Epictetus could participate
in advantages of this kind is generally explained
as the result of a fashionable whim
which possessed Roman nobles at this time
for having philosophers and men of culture
among their slaves. Professor Mahaffy, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>his <i>Greek Life and Thought</i> (p. 132), commenting
on the summons of the two philosophers,
Anaxarchus and Callisthenes, to
console Alexander after his murder of
Cleitus, observes, that it was probably usual
to call in philosophers to minister professionally
in cases of affliction. From this, to
making a philosopher a regular adjunct to a
large household, even as the baron of later
times kept a fool, the step is not great.
But Epaphroditus, one thinks, must have
had frequent reason to rue the choice he
made in Epictetus, if he expected his domestic
philosopher to excuse his misdeeds as
Anaxarchus did those of Alexander on the
occasion above mentioned.</p>

<p>In the year 94 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> the emperor Domitian
issued a decree expelling all philosophers
from Rome&mdash;an easily explainable proceeding
on his part if there were any large number
of them who, in the words of Epictetus,
were able &#8220;to look tyrants steadily in the
face.&#8221; Epictetus must have by this time
obtained his freedom and set up for himself
as a professor of philosophy, for we find him,
in consequence of this decree, betaking himself
to Nicopolis, a city of Epirus. Here he
lived and taught to a venerable age, and
here he delivered the discourses which
Arrian has reported for us. He lived with
great simplicity, and is said to have had no
servant or other inmate of his house until he
hired a nurse for an infant which was about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
to be exposed, according to the practice of
those days when it was desired to check the
inconvenient growth of a family, and which
Epictetus rescued and brought up. The
date of his death is unknown.</p>

<p>And now, reader, I will take my leave of
you with Arrian&#8217;s farewell salutation to
Lucius Gellius, which, literally translated, is
<i>Be strong</i>. If you need it, I know no
teacher better able to make or keep you so
than Epictetus. At any rate, to give him a fair
chance of doing what it is in him to do for
English-speaking men and women is something
I have regarded as a sort of duty, a
discharge of obligation for his infinite service
to myself; which done to the utmost of
my powers, the fewest forewords are the
best.</p>

<h2>THE TEACHING OF EPICTETUS.</h2>

<h3><i>BOOK I.</i></h3>

<h3><br />CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the beginning of philosophy.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Wouldst</span> thou be good, then first believe
that thou art evil.</p>

<p>2. The beginning of philosophy, at least
with those who lay hold of it as they ought
and enter by the door,<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">1</a> is the consciousness
of their own feebleness and incapacity in
respect of necessary things.</p>

<p>3. For we come into the world having by
nature no idea of a right-angled triangle, or
a quarter-tone, or a semi-tone, but by a
certain tradition of art we learn each of these
things. And thus those who know them not,
do not suppose that they know them. But
good and evil, and nobleness and baseness,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>and the seemly and the unseemly, and
happiness and misfortune, and what is our
concern and what is not, and what ought to
be done and what not&mdash;who hath come into
the world without an implanted notion of
these things? Thus we all use these terms,
and endeavor to fit our natural conceptions
to every several thing. <i>He did well, rightly,
not rightly, he failed, he succeeded, he is unrighteous,
he is righteous</i>&mdash;which of us spareth
to use terms like these? Which of us
will defer the use of them till he hath learned
them, even as ignorant men do not use
terms of geometry or music? But this is
the reason of it: we come into the world
already, as it were, taught by Nature some
things in this kind, and setting out from these
things we have added thereto our own conceit.<a name="FNanchor_2_10" id="FNanchor_2_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_10" class="fnanchor">2</a>
<i>For how</i>, saith one, <i>do I not know what
is noble and what is base</i>? Have I not the
notion of it? Truly. <i>And do I not apply it
to things severally?</i> You do apply it. <i>Do I
not, then, apply it rightly?</i> But here lies the
whole question, and here conceit entereth
in. For setting out from things confessed
by all, they go on by a false application to
that which is disputed. For if, in addition to
those things, they had gained also this
power of application, what would then hinder
them to be perfect? But now since you
think that you apply rightly the natural conceptions
to things severally, tell me, whence
have you this assurance?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Because it seems so to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But to another it seems otherwise&mdash;and
he, too, doth he think his application right
or not?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;He doth think it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Can ye, then, both be rightly applying
the conceptions in matters wherein your
opinions contradict each other?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;We cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Have you, then, aught better to show for
your application, or aught above this, that
it seemeth so to you? But what else doth a
madman do than those things that to him
seem right? And doth this rule suffice for
him?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;It doth not suffice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Come, then, to that which is above seeming.
What is this?</p>

<p>4. Behold, the beginning of philosophy is
the observation of how men contradict each
other, and the search whence cometh this
contradiction, and the censure and mistrust
of bare opinion. And it is an inquiry into
that which seems, whether it rightly seems;
and the discovery of a certain rule, even as
we have found a balance for weights, and a
plumb line for straight and crooked. This is
the beginning of philosophy. Are all things
right to all to whom they seem so? But
how can contradictory things be right?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Nay, then, not all things, but those
that seem to us right.&#8221;</p>

<p>And why to you more than the Syrians,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
or to the Egyptians? Why more than to
me or to any other man? Not at all more.
Seeming, then, doth not for every man answer
to Being; for neither in weights or
measures doth the bare appearance content
us, but for each case we have discovered
some rule. And here, then, is there no rule
above seeming? And how could it be that
there were no evidence or discovery of
things the most necessary for men? There
is, then, a rule. And wherefore do we not
seek it, and find it, and, having found it,
henceforth use it without transgression, and
not so much as stretch forth a finger without
it? For this it is, I think, that when it is
discovered cureth of their madness those
that mismeasure all things by seeming
alone; so that henceforth, setting out from
things known and investigated, we may use
an organized body of natural conceptions in
all our several dealings.</p>

<p>5. What is the subject about which we
are inquiring? Pleasure? Submit it to the
rule, cast it into the scales. Now the Good
must be a thing of such sort that we ought
to trust in it? <i>Truly.</i> And we ought to
have faith in it? <i>We ought.</i> And ought we
to trust in anything which is unstable? <i>Nay.</i>
And hath pleasure any stability? <i>It hath not.</i>
Take it, then, and fling it out of the scales,
and set it far away from the place of the
Good. But if you are dim of sight, and one
balance doth not suffice, then take another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Is it right to be elated in what is good? <i>Yea.</i>
And is it right to be elated then in the presence
of a pleasure? See to it that thou say
not it is right; or I shall not hold thee worthy
even of the balance.<a name="FNanchor_3_11" id="FNanchor_3_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_11" class="fnanchor">3</a> Thus are things
judged and weighed, when the rules are
held in readiness. And the aim of philosophy
is this, to examine and establish the
rules. And to use them when they are
known is the task of a wise and good man.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">on the natural conceptions.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> natural conceptions are common
to all men, and one cannot contradict another.
For which of us but affirms that the
Good is profitable, and that we should choose
it, and in all circumstances follow and
pursue it? Which of us but affirms that
uprightness is honorable and becoming?
Where, then, doth the contradiction arise?
Concerning the application of the natural
conceptions to things severally. When one
saith, <i>He did well, he is a worthy man</i>, and
another, <i>Nay, but he did foolishly</i>, then there
is a contradiction among men, one with another.
And there is the same contradiction
among the Jews and the Syrians and the
Egyptians and the Romans; not whether
that which is righteous should be preferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
to all things and in all cases pursued, but
whether this be righteous or unrighteous, to
eat the flesh of swine. And ye can discover
the same contradiction in the matter of
Achilles and Agamemnon. For call them
before us: What sayest thou, Agamemnon,
Should not that which is right and fair come
to pass?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;That should it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And what sayest thou, Achilles, Doth it
not please thee that what is fair and right
should be done?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Of all things this doth most please
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then make application of your natural
conceptions. Whence arose this dispute?
The one saith: <i>I am not bound to deliver up
Chryseis to her father.</i> And the other saith:
<i>Thou art bound.</i> Assuredly one of them
must ill apply the conception of duty. And
again the one saith: <i>Therefore if I should
deliver up Chryseis, it is meet that I take his
prize from one of you.</i> And the other:
<i>Wouldst thou, then, take from me my beloved?</i>
He saith: <i>Yea, even thine.</i> And <i>shall I alone,
and I alone, have nothing</i>? And thus ariseth
the contradiction.</p>

<p>2. What is it, then, to be educated? It is
to learn to apply the natural conceptions to
each thing severally according to nature;
and further, to discern that of things that
exist some are in our own power<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">1</a> and the
rest are not in our own power. And things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
that are in our own power are the will, and
all the works of the will. And things that
are not in our own power are the body, and
the parts of the body, and possessions and
parents and brethren and children and country
and, in a word, our associates. Where
now shall we place the Good? To what
objects shall we apply it? To those which
are in our own power? Then is health not
good, and whole limbs and life? and are not
children and parents and country? And who
will bear with you if you say this? Let us,
then, transfer it to these things. Now, can
one be happy who is injured, and has missed
gaining what is good? He cannot. And
can such a one bear himself towards his fellows
as he ought? How is it possible that
he should? For I have it of nature that I
must seek my own profit. If it profits me
to own a piece of land, it profits me to take
it from my neighbor. If it profits me to
have a garment, it profits me to steal it from
the bath. And hence wars, seditions, tyrannies,
conspiracies. And how shall I be able
to maintain a right mind towards God? for
if I suffer injury and misfortune, it cannot
be but He neglects me. And what have I
to do with Him if He cannot help me? And,
again, what have I to do with Him if He
is willing to let me continue in the evils in
which I am? Henceforth I begin to hate
Him. Why, then, do we build temples and
set up statues to Zeus as we do to powers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
evil, such as Fever?<a name="FNanchor_2_13" id="FNanchor_2_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_13" class="fnanchor">2</a> And how is He now
the Saviour and the Raingiver and the Fruitgiver?
And verily, all this follows, if we
place anywhere in external things the nature
and being of the Good.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the master-faculty.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Of</span> all our faculties ye shall find but
one that can contemplate itself, or, therefore,
approve or disapprove itself. How far
hath grammar the power of contemplation?
Only so far as to judge concerning letters.
And music? Only so far as to judge concerning
melodies. Doth any of them, then,
contemplate itself? Not one. But when
you have need to write to your friend, grammar
will tell you how to write; but whether
to write or not, grammar will not tell. And
so with the musical art in the case of melodies;
but whether it is now meet or not to
sing or to play, music will not tell. What,
then, will tell it? That faculty which both
contemplates itself and all other things.
And what is this? It is the faculty of Reason;
for we have received none other which can
consider itself&mdash;what it is, and what it can,
and what it is worth&mdash;and all the other
faculties as well. For what else is it that
tells us that a golden thing is beautiful, since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
itself doth not? Clearly it is the faculty
which makes use of appearances. What
else is it that judges of music and grammar,
and the other faculties, and proves their
uses, and shows the fit occasions? None
else than this.</p>

<p>2. Thus the Gods, as it was fit they should,
place that only in our power which is the
mightiest and master thing, the right use of
appearances; but other things are not in our
power. Was it that they did not wish it?
I indeed think that had they been able they
had made over to us those things also; but
this they could in no way do. For being
on the earth, and bound up with this flesh
and with these associates, how was it possible
that as regards these we should not be
hindered by external things? But what saith
Zeus? &#8220;Epictetus, if it were possible, I
would have made both this thy little body
and thy little property free and unhampered.
But forget not now that this is but finely
tempered clay, and nothing of thine own.
And since I could not do this, I have given
thee a part of ourselves, this power of desiring
and disliking, and pursuing, avoiding,
and rejecting, and, in brief, the use of appearances.
Have a care, then, of this, hold
this only for thine own, and thou shalt
never be hindered or hampered, thou shalt
not lament, thou shalt not blame, thou shalt
never flatter any man.&#8221; What then? Do
these seem trifling matters? <i>God forbid.</i> Are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
you, then, not content with them? <i>At least
I pray the Gods I may be.</i><a name="FNanchor_1_14" id="FNanchor_1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_14" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>3. But now having one thing in our power
to care for, and to cleave to, we rather
choose to be careful of many things, and
to bind ourselves to many things, even to
the flesh, and to possessions, and to brother
and friend, and child and slave. And being
thus bound to many things, they lie heavy
on us and drag us down. So, if the weather
be not fair for sailing, we sit down distraught
and are ever peering forth to see how stands
the wind. <i>It is north.</i> And what is that to
us? <i>When will the west wind blow?</i> When
it shall seem good to it, friend; or to
&AElig;olus. For it was not thee, but &AElig;olus
whom God made &#8220;steward of the winds.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_2_15" id="FNanchor_2_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_15" class="fnanchor">2</a>
What then? It is right to devise how we
may perfect the things that are our own,
and to use the others as their nature is.
And what, then, is their nature? As it may
please God.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the nature of the good.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> subject for the good and wise man
is his own master-faculty, as the body is for
the physician and the trainer, and the soil is
the subject for the husbandman. And the
work of the good and wise man is to use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
appearances according to Nature. For it is
the nature of every soul to consent to what
is good and to reject what is evil, and to
hold back about what is uncertain; and
thus to be moved to pursue the good and to
avoid the evil, and neither way towards
what is neither good nor evil. For as it is
not lawful for the money-changer or the
seller of herbs to reject C&aelig;sar&#8217;s coin, but if
one present it, then, whether he will or no,
he must give up what is sold for it, so it is
also with the soul. When the Good appears,
straightway the soul is moved towards it,
and from the Evil. And never doth the soul
reject any clear appearance of the good, no
more than C&aelig;sar&#8217;s coin. On this hangeth
every movement both of God and man.</p>

<p>2. The nature and essence of the Good is
in a certain disposition of the Will; likewise
that of the Evil. What, then, are outward
things? Matter for the Will, about which
being occupied it shall attain its own good
or evil. How shall it attain the Good?
Through not being dazzled with admiration
of what it works on.<a name="FNanchor_1_16" id="FNanchor_1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_16" class="fnanchor">1</a> For our opinions of
this, when right, make the will right, and
when wrong make it evil. This law hath
God established, and saith, &#8220;If thou
wouldst have aught of good, have it from
thyself.&#8221;</p>

<p>3. If these things are true (and if we are
not fools or hypocrites), that Good, for man,
lies in the Will, and likewise Evil, and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
other things are nothing to us, why are we
still troubled? why do we fear? The things
for which we have been zealous are in no
other man&#8217;s power; and for the things that
are in others&#8217; power we are not concerned.
What difficulty have we now? <i>But direct
me</i>, sayest thou. And why shall I direct
thee? hath not God directed thee? hath He
not given thee that which is thine own unhindered
and unhampered, and hindered
and hampered that which is not thine own?
And what direction, what word of command
didst thou receive from Him when thou
camest thence? &#8220;Hold fast everything
which is thine own&mdash;covet not that which
is alien to thee. And faithfulness is thine,
and reverence is thine: who, then, can rob
thee of these things? Who can hinder thee
to use them, if not thyself? But thyself can
do it, and how? When thou art zealous
about things not thine own, and hast cast
away the things that are.&#8221; With such counsels
and commands from Zeus, what wilt
thou still from me? Am I greater than he?
am I more worthy of thy faith? But if thou
hold to these things, of what others hast
thou need? <i>But perchance these are none of
his commands?</i> Then bring forward the
natural conceptions, bring the proofs of the
philosophers, bring the things thou hast
often heard, bring the things that thyself
hast spoken, bring what thou hast read,
bring what thou hast pondered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the promise of philosophy.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Of</span> things that exist, some are in our
own power, some are not in our own power.
Of things that are in our own power are our
opinions, impulses, pursuits, avoidances,
and, in brief, all that is of our own doing.
Of things that are not in our own power
are the body, possessions, reputation,
authority, and, in brief, all that is not of
our own doing. And the things that are in
our own power are in their nature free, not
liable to hindrance or embarrassment, while
the things that are not in our own power are
strengthless, servile, subject, alien.</p>

<p>2. Remember, then, if you hold things by
their nature subject to be free, and things
alien to be your proper concern, you will be
hampered, you will lament, you will be
troubled, you will blame Gods and men.
But if you hold that only to be your own
which is so, and the alien for what it is,
alien, then none shall ever compel you,
none shall hinder you, you will blame no
one, accuse no one, you will not do the
least thing unwillingly, none shall harm
you, you shall have no foe, for you shall
suffer no injury.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>3. Aiming, then, at things so high, remember
that it is no moderate passion
wherewith you must attempt them, but
some things you must utterly renounce, and
put some, for the present, aside. For if,
let us say, you aim also at this, to rule and
to gather riches, then you are like, through
aiming at the chief things also, to miss these
lower ends; and shall most assuredly miss
those others, through which alone freedom
and happiness are won. Straightway, then,
practice saying to every harsh appearance&mdash;<i>Thou
art an Appearance and not at all the
thing thou appearest to be</i>. Then examine
it, and prove it by the rules you have, but
first and above all by this, whether it concern
something that is in our own power, or
something that is not in our own power.
And if the latter, then be the thought at
hand: <i>It is nothing to Me.</i></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the way of philosophy.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">A</span> certain Roman having entered with
his son and listened to one lecture, &#8220;This,&#8221;
said Epictetus, &#8220;is the manner of teaching;&#8221;
and he was silent. But when the other
prayed him to continue, he spake as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Every art is wearisome, in the learning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
of it, to the untaught and unskilled. Yet
things that are made by the arts immediately
declare their use, and for what they were
made, and in most of them is something
attractive and pleasing. And thus when a
shoemaker is learning his trade it is no
pleasure to stand by and observe him, but
the shoe is useful, and moreover not unpleasing
to behold. And the learning of a
carpenter&#8217;s trade is very grievous to an untaught
person who happens to be present,
but the work done declares the need of the
art. But far more is this seen in music, for
if you are by where one is learning, it will
appear the most painful of all instructions;
but that which is produced by the musical
art is sweet and delightful to hear, even to
those who are untaught in it. And here we
conceive the work of one who studies
philosophy to be some such thing, that he
must fit his desire to all events, so that
nothing may come to pass against our will,
nor may aught fail to come to pass that we
wish for. Whence it results to those who so
order it, that they never fail to obtain what
they would, nor to avoid what they would
not, living, as regards themselves, without
pain, fear, or trouble; and as regards their
fellows, observing all the relations, natural
and acquired; as son or father, or brother
or citizen, or husband or wife, or neighbor
or fellow-traveler, or prince or subject.
Such we conceive to be the work of one who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
pursues philosophy. And next we must inquire
how this may come about.</p>

<p>2. We see, then, that the carpenter becomes
a carpenter by learning something,
and by learning something the pilot becomes
a pilot. And here also is it not on this wise?
Is it enough that we merely wish to become
good and wise, or must we not also learn
something? We inquire, then, what we
have to learn?</p>

<p>3. The philosophers say that, before all
things, it is needful to learn that God is,
and taketh thought for all things; and that
nothing can be hid from Him, neither deeds,
nor even thoughts or wishes. Thereafter,
of what nature the Gods are. For whatever
they are found to be, he who would please
and serve them must strive, with all his
might, to be like unto them. If the Divine
is faithful, so must he be faithful; if free, so
must he be free; if beneficent, so must he
be beneficent; if high-minded, so must he be
high-minded; so that thus emulating God,
he shall both do and speak the things that
follow therefrom.<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>4. Whence, then, shall we make a beginning?
If you will consider this with me, I
shall say, first, that you must attend to the
sense of words.<a name="FNanchor_2_18" id="FNanchor_2_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_18" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;So I do not now understand them?&#8221;</p>

<p>You do not.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;How, then, do I use them?&#8221;</p>

<p>As the unlettered use written words, or as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
cattle use appearances; for the use is one
thing and understanding another. But if
you think you understand, then take any
word you will,<a name="FNanchor_3_19" id="FNanchor_3_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_19" class="fnanchor">3</a> and let us try ourselves,
whether we understand it. But it is hateful
to be confuted, for a man now old, and one
who, perhaps, hath served his three campaigns!
And I too know this. For you
have come to me now as one who lacketh
nothing. And what could you suppose to
be lacking to you? Wealth have you, and
children, and it may be a wife, and many
servants; C&aelig;sar knows you, you have won
many friends in Rome, you give every man
his due, you reward with good him that doeth
good to you, and with evil him that doeth
evil. What is still lacking to you? If, now,
I shall show you that you lack the greatest
and most necessary things for happiness,
and that to this day you have cared for
everything rather than for what behooved
you; and if I crown all and say that you
know not what God is nor what man is, nor
Good nor Evil;&mdash;and what I say of other
things is perhaps endurable, but if I say you
know not your own self, how can you endure
me, and bear the accusation, and abide
here? Never&mdash;but straightway you will go
away in anger. And yet what evil have I
done you? Unless the mirror doth evil to
the ill-favored man, when it shows him to
himself such as he is, and unless the physician
is thought to affront the sick man when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
he may say to him: <i>Man, dost thou think
thou ailest nothing? Thou hast a fever: fast
to-day and drink water.</i> And none saith,
<i>What an affront</i>. But if one shall say to a
man: <i>Thy pursuits art inflamed, thine avoidances
are mean, thy purposes are lawless, thy
impulses accord not with nature, thine opinions
are vain and lying</i>&mdash;straightway he goeth
forth and saith, <i>He affronted me</i>.</p>

<p>5. We follow our business as in a great
fair. Cattle and oxen are brought to be
sold; and the greater part of the men come
some to buy, some to sell; and few are
they who come for the spectacle of the fair,&mdash;how
it comes to pass, and wherefore, and
who are they who have established it, and
to what end. And so it is here, too, in this
assembly of life. Some, indeed, like cattle,
concern themselves with nothing but fodder;
even such as those that care for possessions
and lands and servants and offices, for these
are nothing more than fodder. But few are
they who come to the fair for love of the
spectacle, what the world is and by whom
it is governed. By no one? And how is it
possible that a state or a house cannot endure,
no not for the shortest time, without
a governor and overseer, but this so great
and fair fabric should be guided thus orderly
by chance and accident? There is, then,
one who governs. But what is his nature?
and how doth he govern? and we, that were
made by him, what are we, and for what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
are we? or have we at least some intercourse
and link with him, or have we none?
Thus it is that these few are moved, and
thenceforth study this alone, to learn about
the fair, and to depart. What then? they
are mocked by the multitude. And in the
fair, too, the observers are mocked by the
traders; and had the cattle any reflection
they would mock all those who cared for
anything else than fodder.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">to the learner.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Remember</span> that pursuit declares the aim
of attaining the thing pursued, and avoidance
that of not falling into the thing
shunned; and he who fails in his pursuit is
unfortunate, and it is misfortune to fall into
what he would avoid. If now you shun
only those things in your power which are
contrary to Nature, you shall never fall into
what you would avoid. But if you shun
disease or death or poverty, you shall have
misfortune.</p>

<p>2. Turn away, then, your avoidance from
things not in our power, and set it upon
things contrary to Nature which are in our
power. And let pursuit for the present be
utterly effaced; for if you are pursuing
something that is not in our power, it must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
needs be that you miscarry, and of things
that are, as many as you may rightly aim
at, none are yet open to you. But use only
desire and aversion, and that indeed lightly,
and with reserve, and indifferently.</p>

<p>3. No great thing cometh suddenly into
being, for not even a bunch of grapes can,
or a fig. If you say to me now:<i> I desire a fig</i>,
I answer that there is need of time: let it
first of all flower, and then bring forth the
fruit, and then ripen. When the fruit of a
fig-tree is not perfected at once, and in a
single hour, would you win the fruit of a
man&#8217;s mind thus quickly and easily? Even
if I say to you, expect it not.</p>

<p>4. To fulfill the promise of a man&#8217;s nature
is itself no common thing. For what is a
man? <i>A living creature</i>, say you; <i>mortal,
and endowed with Reason</i>. And from what
are we set apart by Reason? <i>From the wild
beasts.</i> And what others? <i>From sheep and
the like.</i> Look to it, then, that thou do nothing
like a wild beast, for if thou do, the man
in thee perisheth, thou hast not fulfilled his
promise. Look to it, that thou do nothing
like a sheep, or thus too the man hath perished.
<i>What, then, can we do as sheep?</i>
When we are gluttonous, sensual, reckless,
filthy, thoughtless, to what are we then
sunken? To sheep. What have we lost?
Our faculty of Reason. And when we are
contentious, and hurtful, and angry, and
violent, to what are we sunken? To wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
beasts. And for the rest some of us are
great wild beasts, and some of us little and
evil ones; whereby we may say, &#8220;Let me
at least be eaten by a lion.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1_20" id="FNanchor_1_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_20" class="fnanchor">1</a> But through
all these things the promise of the man&#8217;s
nature has been ruined.</p>

<p>5. For when is a complex proposition
safe?<a name="FNanchor_2_21" id="FNanchor_2_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_21" class="fnanchor">2</a> When it fulfills its promise. So that
the validity of a complex proposition is when
it is a complex of truths. And when is a
disjunctive safe? When it fulfills its promise.
And when are flutes, or a lyre, or a horse,
or a dog? What marvel is it, then, if a man
also is to be saved in the same way, and
perish in the same way?</p>

<p>6. But each thing is increased and saved
by the corresponding works&mdash;the carpenter
by the practice of carpentry, the grammarian
by the study of grammar; but if he use to
write ungrammatically, it must needs be
that his art shall be corrupted and destroyed.
Thus, too, the works of reverence save the
reverent man, and those of shamelessness
destroy him. And works of faithfulness save
the faithful man, and the contrary destroy
him. And men of the contrary character
are strengthened therein by contrary deeds;
the irreverent by irreverence, the faithless
by faithlessness, the reviler by reviling, the
angry by anger, the avaricious by unfair
giving and taking.</p>

<p>7. Know, that not easily shall a conviction
arise in a man unless he every day speak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
the same things and hear the same things,
and at the same time apply them unto
life.</p>

<p>8. Every great power is perilous to beginners.
Thou must bear such things according
to thy strength. <i>But I must live according
to Nature?</i> That is not for a sick
man.<a name="FNanchor_3_22" id="FNanchor_3_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_22" class="fnanchor">3</a> Lead thy life as a sick man for a while,
so that thou mayest hereafter live it as a
whole man. Fast, drink water, abstain for
a while from pursuit of every kind, in order
that thou mayest pursue as Reason bids.
And if as Reason bids, then when thou shalt
have aught of good in thee, thy pursuit shall
be well. <i>Nay, but we would live as sages and
do good to men.</i> What good? What wilt
thou do? Hast thou done good to thyself?
But thou wouldst exhort them? And hast
thou exhorted thyself?<a name="FNanchor_4_23" id="FNanchor_4_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_23" class="fnanchor">4</a> Thou wouldst do
them good&mdash;then do not chatter to them, but
show them in thyself what manner of men
philosophy can make. In thy eating do
good to those that eat with thee, in thy
drinking to those that drink, by yielding and
giving place to all, and bearing with them.
Thus do them good, and not by spitting thy
bile upon them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the cynic.<a name="FNanchor_1_24" id="FNanchor_1_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_24" class="fnanchor">1</a></span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">One</span> of his pupils, who seemed to be
drawn towards the way of Cynicism, inquired
of Epictetus what manner of man the Cynic
ought to be, and what was the natural conception
of the thing. And Epictetus said:
Let us look into it at leisure. But so much
I have now to say to you, that whosoever
shall without God attempt so great a matter
stirreth up the wrath of God against him,
and desireth only to behave himself unseemly
before the people. For in no well-ordered
house doth one come in and say to
himself: <i>I should be the steward of the house</i>,
else, when the lord of the house shall have
observed it, and seeth him insolently giving
orders, he will drag him forth and chastise
him. So it is also, in this great city of the
universe, for here too there is a master of
the house who ordereth each and all:
Thou art the Sun; thy power is to travel
round and to make the year and the seasons,
and to increase and nourish fruits, and to
stir the winds and still them, and temperately
to warm the bodies of men. Go forth,
run thy course, and minister thus to the
greatest things and to the least. Thou art<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
a calf; when a lion shall appear, do what
befits thee, or it shall be worse for thee.
Thou art a bull; come forth and fight, for
this is thy part and pride, and this thou
canst. Thou art able to lead the army
against Ilion; be Agamemnon. Thou canst
fight in single combat with Hector; be
Achilles. But if Thersites came forth and
pretended to the authority, then either he
would not gain it, or, gaining it, he would
have been shamed before many witnesses.</p>

<p>2. And about this affair, do thou take
thought upon it earnestly, for it is not such
as it seemeth to thee. <i>I wear a rough cloak
now, and I shall wear it then;<a name="FNanchor_2_25" id="FNanchor_2_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_25" class="fnanchor">2</a> I sleep hard
now, and I shall sleep so then. I will take to
myself a wallet and staff, and I will begin to
go about and beg, and to reprove every one I
meet with; and if I shall see one that plucks
out his hairs, I will censure him, or one that
hath his hair curled, or that goes in purple
raiment.</i> If thou conceivest the matter on
this wise, far be it from thee&mdash;go not near
it, it is not for thee. But if thou conceivest
of it as it is, and holdest thyself not unworthy
of it, then behold to how great an
enterprise thou art putting forth thine hand.</p>

<p>3. First, in things that concern thyself,
thou must appear in nothing like unto what
thou now doest. Thou must not accuse God
nor man; thou must utterly give over pursuit,
and avoid only those things that are in
the power of thy will; anger is not meet for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
thee, nor resentment, nor envy, nor pity;<a name="FNanchor_3_26" id="FNanchor_3_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_26" class="fnanchor">3</a>
nor must a girl appear to thee fair, nor
must reputation, nor a flat cake.<a name="FNanchor_4_27" id="FNanchor_4_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_27" class="fnanchor">4</a> For it
must be understood that other men shelter
themselves by walls and houses and by
darkness when they do such things, and
many means of concealment have they.
One shutteth the door, placeth some one before
the chamber; <i>if any one should come,
say, He is out, he is busy</i>. But in place of all
these things it behooves the Cynic to shelter
himself behind his own piety and reverence;
but if he doth not, he shall be put to shame,
naked under the sky. This is his house,
this his door, this the guards of his chamber,
this his darkness. For he must not seek to
hide aught that he doeth, else he is gone, the
Cynic hath perished, the man who lived
under the open sky, the freeman. He hath
begun to fear something from without, he
hath begun to need concealment; nor can
he find it when he would, for where shall he
hide himself, and how? And if by chance
this tutor, this public teacher, should be
found in guilt, what things must he not
suffer! And fearing these things, can he yet
take heart with his whole soul to guide the
rest of mankind? That can he never: it is
impossible!</p>

<p>4. First, then, thou must purify thy ruling
faculty and this vocation of thine also, saying:
Now it is my mind I must shape, as
the carpenter shapes wood and the shoe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>maker
leather; and the thing to be formed
is a right use of appearances. But nothing
to me is the body, and nothing to me the
parts of it. <i>Death?</i> Let it come when it
will, either death of the whole or of a part.
<i>Flee it!</i> And whither? Can any man cast
me out of the universe? He cannot; but
whithersoever I may go there will be the
sun, and the moon, and there the stars, and
visions, and omens, and communion with
the Gods.<a name="FNanchor_5_28" id="FNanchor_5_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_28" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>5. And, furthermore, when he hath thus
fashioned himself, he will not be content
with these things, who is a Cynic indeed.
But know that he is an herald from God to
men, declaring to them the truth about good
and evil things; that they have erred, and
are seeking the reality of good and evil
where it is not; and where it is, they do not
consider; and he is a spy, like Diogenes,
when he was led captive to Philip after the
battle of Ch&aelig;ronea.<a name="FNanchor_6_29" id="FNanchor_6_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_29" class="fnanchor">6</a> For the Cynic is, in
truth, a spy of the things that are friendly to
men, and that are hostile; and having
closely spied out all, he must come back
and declare the truth. And he must neither
be stricken with terror and report of enemies
where none are; nor be in any otherwise
confounded or troubled by the appearances.</p>

<p>6. He must then be able, if so it chance,
to go up impassioned, as on the tragic stage,
and speak that word of Socrates, &#8220;O men,
whither are ye borne away? What do ye?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Miserable as ye are! like blind men ye
wander up and down. Ye have left the
true road, and are going by a false; ye are
seeking peace and happiness where they
are not, and if another shall show you where
they are, ye believe him not. Wherefore will
ye seek it in outward things? <i>In the body?</i>
It is not there&mdash;and if ye believe me not, lo,
Myro! lo, Ophellius.<a name="FNanchor_7_30" id="FNanchor_7_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_30" class="fnanchor">7</a> <i>In possessions?</i> It
is not there, and if ye believe me not, lo,
Cr&oelig;sus! lo, the wealthy of our own day, how
full of mourning is their life! <i>In authority?</i>
It is not there, else should those be happy
who have been twice or thrice consul; yet
they are not. Whom shall we believe in this
matter? You, who look but on these men
from without, and are dazzled by the appearance,
or the men themselves? And
what say they? Hearken to them when they
lament, when they groan, when by reason
of those consulships, and their glory and
renown, they hold their state the more full
of misery and danger! <i>In royalty?</i> It is
not there; else were Nero happy and Sardanapalus;
but not Agamemnon himself
was happy, more splendid though he was
than Nero or Sardanapalus; but while the
rest are snoring what is he doing?&#8221;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;He tore his rooted hair by handfuls out.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Il.</i> x.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And what saith himself? &#8220;I am distraught,&#8221;
he saith, &#8220;and I am in anguish;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
my heart leaps forth from my bosom.&#8221;&mdash;[<i>Il.</i> x.]
Miserable man! which of thy concerns
hath gone wrong with thee? Thy
wealth? Nay. Thy body? Nay; but thou
art rich in gold and bronze. What ails thee
then? That part, whatever it be, with which
we pursue, with which we avoid, with which
we desire and dislike, thou hast neglected
and corrupted. How hath it been neglected?
He hath been ignorant of the true Good for
which it was born, and of the Evil; and of
what is his own, and what is alien to him.
And when it goeth ill with something that
is alien to him, he saith, <i>Woe is me, for the
Greeks are in peril.</i> O unhappy mind of thee!
of all things alone neglected and untended.
<i>They will be slain by the Trojans and die!</i>
And if the Trojans slay them not, will
they not still die? <i>Yea, but not all together.</i>
What, then, doth it matter? for if it be an
evil to die, it is alike evil to die together
or to die one by one. Shall anything else
happen to them than the parting of body and
soul? <i>Nothing.</i> And when the Greeks have
perished, is the door closed to thee? canst
thou not also die? <i>I can.</i> Wherefore, then,
dost thou lament: <i>Woe is me, a king, and
bearing the scepter of Zeus</i>? There is no
unfortunate king, as there is no unfortunate
God. What, then, art thou? In very truth
a shepherd; for thou lamentest even as shepherds
do when a wolf hath snatched away
one of the sheep; and sheep are they whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
thou dost rule. And why art thou come
hither? Was thy faculty of pursuit in any
peril, or of avoidance, or thy desire or aversion?
<i>Nay</i>, he saith, <i>but my brother&#8217;s wife
was carried away</i>. Was it not a great gain to
be rid of an adulterous wife? <i>Shall we be,
then, despised of the Trojans?</i> Of the Trojan?
Of what manner of men? of wise men
or fools? If of wise men, why do ye make
war with them? if of fools, why do ye heed
them?<a name="FNanchor_8_31" id="FNanchor_8_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_31" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>7. <i>In what, then, is the good, seeing that in
these things it is not? Tell us, thou, my lord
missionary and spy!</i> It is there where ye
deem it not, and where ye have no desire to
seek it. For did ye desire, ye would have
found it in yourselves, nor would ye wander
to things without, nor pursue things alien, as
if they were your own concerns. Turn to
your own selves; understand the natural
conceptions which ye possess. What kind of
thing do ye take the Good to be? Peace?
happiness? freedom? Come, then, do ye
not naturally conceive it as great, as precious,
and that cannot be harmed? What kind of
material, then, will ye take to shape peace
and freedom withal&mdash;that which is enslaved
or in that which is free? <i>That which is free.</i>
Have ye the flesh enslaved or free? <i>We
know not.</i> Know ye not that it is the slave
of fever, of gout, of ophthalmia, of dysentery,
of tyranny, and fire, and steel, and
everything that is mightier than itself? <i>Yea,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
it is enslaved.</i> How, then, can aught that is
of the body be free? and how can that be
great or precious which by nature is dead,
mere earth or mud?</p>

<p>8. What then? have ye nothing that is
free? <i>It may be nothing.</i> And who can
compel you to assent to an appearance that
is false? <i>No man.</i> And who can compel
you not to assent to an appearance that is
true? <i>No man.</i> Here, then, ye see that there
is in you something that is by nature free.
But which of you, except he lay hold of
some appearance of the profitable, or of the
becoming, can either pursue or avoid, or
desire or dislike, or adapt or intend anything?
<i>No man.</i> In these things, too,
then, ye have something that is unhindered
and free. This, miserable men, must ye
perfect; this have a care to, in this seek
for the Good.</p>

<p>9. <i>And how is it possible that one can live
prosperously who hath nothing; a naked,
homeless, hearthless, beggarly man, without
servants, without a country?</i> Lo, God hath
sent you a man to show you in very deed
that it is possible. Behold me, that I
have neither country, nor house, nor possessions,
nor servants; I sleep on the ground;
nor is a wife mine, nor children, nor domicile,
but only earth and heaven, and a single
cloak. And what is lacking to me? do
ever I grieve? do I fear? am I not free?
When did any of you see me fail of my pur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>suit,
or meet with what I had avoided?
When did I blame God or man? When did I
accuse any man? When did any of you see
me of a sullen countenance? How do I meet
those whom ye fear and marvel at? Do I
not treat them as my slaves? Who that
seeth me, but thinketh he beholdeth his
king and his lord?</p>

<p>10. So these are the accents of the Cynic,
this his character, this his design. Not so&mdash;but
it is his bag, and his staff, and his
great jaws; and to devour all that is given
to him, or store it up, or to reprove out of
season every one that he may meet, or to
show off his shoulder.<a name="FNanchor_9_32" id="FNanchor_9_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_32" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>11. Dost thou see how thou art about to
take in hand so great a matter? Take first
a mirror, look upon thy shoulders, mark
well thy loins and thighs. Thou art about
to enter thy name for the Olympic games, O
man; no cold and paltry contest. Nor
canst thou then be merely overcome and
then depart; but first thou must be shamed
in the sight of all the world; and not alone of
the Athenians, or Laced&aelig;monians, or Nicopolitans.
And then if thou hast too rashly
entered upon the contest thou must be
thrashed, and before being thrashed must
suffer thirst and scorching heat, and swallow
much dust.</p>

<p>12. Consider more closely, know thyself,
question thy genius,<a name="FNanchor_10_33" id="FNanchor_10_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_33" class="fnanchor">10</a> attempt nothing without
God; who, if He counsel thee, be sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
that He wills thee either to be great or
to be greatly plagued. For this very agreeable
circumstance is linked with the calling
of a Cynic; he must be flogged like an ass,
and, being flogged, must love those who
flog him, as though he were the father or
brother of all mankind. Not so, but if one
shall flog thee, stand in the midst and
shriek out, <i>O C&aelig;sar, what things do I suffer
in the Emperor&#8217;s peace! Let us take him before
the pro-consul.</i> But what is C&aelig;sar to
the Cynic? or what is a pro-consul? or
what is any other than He that hath sent
him hither, and whom he serveth, which is
Zeus? Doth he call upon any other than
God? Is he not persuaded, whatsoever
things he may suffer, that he is being
trained and exercised by God? Hercules,
when he was exercised by Eurystheus, never
deemed himself wretched; but fulfilled
courageously all that was laid upon him.
But he who shall cry out and bear it hard
when he is being trained and exercised by
Zeus, is he worthy to bear the scepter of
Diogenes? Hear what Diogenes saith,
when ill of a fever, to the bystanders: <i>Base
souls, will ye not remain? To see the overthrow
and combat of athletes, how great a way
ye journey to Olympia; and have ye no will to
see a combat between a fever and a man?</i>
And will such an one presently accuse God
who hath sent him, as having used him ill&mdash;he
who was glorying in his lot, and held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
himself worthy to be a spectacle to the bystanders?
For of what shall he accuse Him:
that his life is seemly, that he manifests
God&#8217;s will, that he showeth forth his virtue
more brightly? Come, then; and what
saith he about death, about pain? How
did he compare his own happiness with that
of the Great King? nay, he thought rather
that there was no comparison. For where
there are confusions, and griefs, and fears,
and unattained pursuits, and avoidance in
vain, and envy and rivalry, can the way to
happiness lie there? But where rotten opinions
are there must of necessity be all these
things.</p>

<p>13. And the young man having asked
whether one that hath fallen ill shall obey,
if a friend desire that he will go home with
him and be tended: Where, he said, will
you show me the friend of a Cynic? For
he himself must be even such another, so as
to be worthy to be reckoned his friend. A
sharer in the scepter and the royalty must he
be, and a worthy servant, if he will be worthy
of his friendship, as Diogenes was of
Antisthenes and Crates of Diogenes. Or
seems it so to thee that whosoever shall
come to him and bid him hail is his friend?
and that he will think him worthy that a
Cynic shall go to his house? Thus if it
please thee to be a Cynic, bethink thee
rather of such a thing as this, and cast
about for a dainty dungheap whereon to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
have thy fever; and see that it look away
from the north, so that thou be not chilled.
But thou seemest to me to wish to retreat
into somebody&#8217;s house and spend thy time
there, and be fed. What hast thou to do
with undertaking so great a matter?</p>

<p>14.<i> But marriage</i>, said he, <i>and the begetting
of children,&mdash;are these to be received by
the Cynic among his chief purposes?</i></p>

<p>Give me, said Epictetus, a city of wise
men, and perhaps no one will easily come
to the Cynic way: for whose sake should
he embrace it? However, if we do suppose
such a thing, there is nothing to hinder his
marrying and begetting children; for his
wife will be even such another, and his
father-in-law such another, and thus will his
children be brought up. But things being
as they now are, as it were in order of battle,
must not the Cynic be given wholly and
undistracted to the service of God, being able
to go about among men, and not bound to
private duties, nor entangled in ties which,
if he transgress, he can no longer preserve
the aspect of honesty and goodness; and if
he obey them, he hath lost that of the missionary,
the spy, the herald of the Gods?
For see! he must needs observe a certain
conduct towards his father-in-law, and he
hath somewhat to render also to the rest of
his wife&#8217;s kin and to his wife herself. And
for the rest, he is shut off from Cynicism by
the care for sickness, or means of livelihood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
For one thing alone, he must have a vessel
for warming water for his little child, where
he may wash it in the bath; and wool for
his wife when she has been delivered, and
oil, and a couch, and a drinking cup&mdash;already
a number of utensils&mdash;and other
affairs and distractions. Where shall I thenceforth
find that king, whose business is the
common weal?</p>

<p>on whom it lies to oversee all men, the married,
and parents, and who useth his wife
well, and who ill, and who wrangles, and
what household is well-ordered, and what
not; going about as a physician, and feeling
pulses&mdash;&#8220;thou hast a fever, thou a headache,
thou the gout; do thou fast, do thou
eat, do thou avoid the bath, thou needest
the knife, thou the cautery?&#8221; Where is the
place for leisure to one who is bound to private
duties? Must he not provide raiment
for his children? yea, and send them to the
schoolmaster with their tablets and writing
instruments? and have a bed ready for
them, since a man cannot be a Cynic from
the womb? Else were it better to cast them
away at once than kill them in this way.
See, now, to what we have brought our
Cynic&mdash;how we have taken away his kingship
from him! <i>True, but Crates married.</i>
Thou speakest of a circumstance that arose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
from love, and adducest a wife who was
another Crates.<a name="FNanchor_11_34" id="FNanchor_11_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_34" class="fnanchor">11</a> But our inquiry is concerning
common marriages, and how men
may be undistracted; and thus inquiring,
we do not find it, in this condition of the
world, a purpose of chief concern for a
Cynic.</p>

<p>15. <i>How, then</i>, said he, <i>shall he still be preserving
the community?</i> God help thee!
Whether do they best serve mankind who
fill their own place by bringing into the
world two or three screaming children, or
those who, as far they may, oversee all
men, what they do, how they live, wherewith
they concern themselves, and what
duties they neglect? And were the Thebans
more benefited by as many as left their
little children behind, or by Epaminondas,
who died childless? And did Priam, who
begat fifty good-for-nothing sons, or Danaus,
or &AElig;olus,<a name="FNanchor_12_35" id="FNanchor_12_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_35" class="fnanchor">12</a> better serve the community than
Homer? Shall, then, the command of an
army or the writing of poems withdraw a
man from marriage and fatherhood, and he
shall not be thought to have gained nothing
for his childlessness, but the kingship of a
Cynic shall be not worth what it costs? It
may be we do not perceive his greatness,
nor do we worthily conceive of the character
of Diogenes; but we turn away our eyes
to the present Cynics, &#8220;watch-dogs of the
dining-room,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_13_36" id="FNanchor_13_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_36" class="fnanchor">13</a> who in nothing resemble
those others, save perchance in breaking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
wind; but in no other thing. For else these
things would not have moved us, nor should
we have marveled if a Cynic will not marry
nor beget children. Man! he hath begotten
all mankind, he hath all men for his
sons, all women for his daughters; so doth
he visit all and care for all. Thinkest thou
that he is a mere meddler and busybody in
rebuking those whom he meets? As a
father he doth it, as a brother, and as servant
of the Universal Father, which is God.</p>

<p>16. If it please thee, ask of me also whether
he shall have to do with affairs of public
polity? Fool! dost thou seek a greater
polity than that in whose affairs he is already
concerned? Will it be greater if he come
forward among the Athenians to say something
about ways or means&mdash;he, whose part
it is to discourse with all men, Athenians,
Corinthians, Romans alike, not concerning
means or ways, nor concerning peace or
war, but about happiness and unhappiness,
about good-fortune and ill-fortune, about
slavery and freedom? And of a man that
hath his part in so great a polity will you ask
me if he shall attend to public affairs? Ask
me also if he shall be a ruler; and again I
shall say, Thou fool, what rule can be greater
than his?</p>

<p>17. And to such a man there is need also
of a certain kind of body. For if he shall
appear consumptive, meager, and pale, his
witness hath not the same emphasis. Not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
only by showing forth the things of the spirit
must he convince foolish men that it is possible,
without the things that are admired of
them, to be good and wise, but also in his
body must he show that plain and simple
and open-air living are not mischievous
even to the body: &#8220;Behold, even of this I
am a witness, I and my body.&#8221; So Diogenes
was wont to do, for he went about radiant
with health, and with his very body he
turned many to good. But a Cynic that
men pity seems to be a beggar&mdash;all men
turn away from him, all stumble at him.
For he must not appear squalid; so that
neither in this respect shall he scare men
away; but his very austerity should be
cleanly and pleasing.</p>

<p>18. Much grace of body, then, must belong
to the Cynic, and also quickness of
mind, else he is a mere clot of slime and
nothing else; for he must be ready and apt
to meet all that may befall him. Thus when
one said to Diogenes: <i>Thou art that Diogenes
who thinkest there are no Gods</i>, he replied,
<i>And how may that be, seeing I hold thee
hateful to the Gods?</i> And again, when Alexander
stood beside him, as he was lying
asleep, and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Not all night must a man of counsel sleep,&#8221;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>he answered, ere he was yet awake:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Warden of men, and with so many cares.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_14_37" id="FNanchor_14_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_37" class="fnanchor">14</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>19. But before all things must his ruling
faculty be purer than the sun, else he must
needs be a gambler and cheater, who, being
himself entangled in some iniquity, will reprove
others. For, see how the matter
stands: to these kings and tyrants, their
spearmen and their arms give the office of
reproving men, and the power to punish
transgressors, yea, though they themselves
be evil; but to the Cynic, instead of arms
and spearmen, his conscience giveth this
power. When he knows that he has watched
and labored for men, and lain down to
sleep in purity, and sleep hath left him yet
purer; and that his thoughts have been the
thoughts of one dear to the Gods, of a servant,
and a sharer in the rule of Zeus; and he
hath had ever at hand that</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Lead me, O Zeus, and thou Destiny,<a name="FNanchor_15_38" id="FNanchor_15_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_38" class="fnanchor">15</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>and,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;If thus it be pleasing to the Gods, so may it be&#8221;&mdash;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>wherefore, then, shall he not take heart to
speak boldly to his brothers, to his children,
in a word, to all his kin? For this reason,
he that is in this state is no meddler or busybody,
for when he overlooks human affairs
he meddles not with foreign matters, but
with his own affairs. Else, name the general
a busybody when he overlooks his soldiers,
and reviews them, and watches them, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
punishes the disorderly. But if you have a
flat cake under your cloak while you reprove
others, I say, get hence rather into a corner,
and eat what thou hast stolen&mdash;what are
other men&#8217;s concerns to thee? For what
art thou&mdash;the bull of the herd? or the queen
bee? Show me the tokens of thy supremacy,
such as nature hath given her. But if thou
art a drone claiming sovereignty over the
bees, thinkest thou not that thy fellow-citizens
will overthrow thee, as bees do the
drones?</p>

<p>20. And truly the Cynic must be so long-suffering
as that he shall seem to the multitude
insensate and a stone. Him doth none
revile, nor smite, nor insult; but his body
hath he given to any man to use at will.
For he remembers that the worse must needs
be vanquished by the better, whereinsoever
it is the worse; and the body is worse
than the multitude&mdash;the weaker than the
stronger. Never, then, doth he go down to
any contest where it is possible for him to
be vanquished, but he yields up all that is
not his own, and contends for nothing that
is subject to others. But where there is
question of the will and the use of appearances,
then you shall see how many eyes he
hath, so that you may say that compared
with him Argus was blind. Is his assent
ever hasty; or his desire idle; or his pursuit
in vain; or his avoidance unsuccessful;
or his aim unfulfilled? doth he ever blame,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
or cringe, or envy? This is his great study
and his design; but as regards all other
things, he lies on his back and snores, for
all is peace. There is no thief of his will,
nor tyrant; but of his body? yea; and of
his chattels? yea, and also of his authority
and his honors. What, then, are these
things to him? So when one may seek to
make him afraid on account of them&mdash;<i>Go
hence</i>, he saith to him, <i>and find out little
children; it is to these that masks are dreadful,
but I know they are made of clay, and that
inside them there is nothing.</i></p>

<p>21. On such a matter art thou now meditating.
Therefore, if it please thee, in God&#8217;s
name delay it yet awhile, and see first what
ability thou hast for it. For mark what
Hector speaks to Andromache: <i>Go</i>, he saith,
<i>rather into the house and weave</i>&mdash;</p>

<h3><i>BOOK II.</i></h3>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">on genuine and borrowed beliefs.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> master-argument seems to start
from propositions such as these:<a name="FNanchor_1_39" id="FNanchor_1_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_39" class="fnanchor">1</a> There
being a mutual contradiction among these
three propositions&mdash;(1) &#8220;Every past event
is necessarily true,&#8221; and (2) &#8220;An impossibility
cannot follow a possibility,&#8221; and (3)
&#8220;Things are possible which neither are nor
will be true,&#8221; Diodorus, perceiving this contradiction,
made use of the force of the first
two in order to prove that nothing is possible
which neither is nor will be true. And,
again, one will hold these two, (3) that a
thing is possible which neither is nor will be
true, and (2) that an impossibility cannot
follow from a possibility; but by no means
that every past thing is necessarily true, and
thus those of the school of Cleanthes appear
to think, whom Antipater strongly defended.
But some hold the other two, (3) that a thing
is possible that neither is nor will be true,
and (1) that every past event is necessarily
true; but maintain that an impossibility may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
follow from a possibility. But all three it is
impossible to hold at once, because of their
mutual contradiction.</p>

<p>2. Now, if any one inquire of me, <i>And which
of these dost thou hold?</i> I shall answer him
that I do not know, but I have received this
account, that Diodorus holds certain of
them, and I think the followers of Panthoides
and Cleanthes certain others, and those of
Chrysippus yet others. <i>And thyself?</i> Nay,
it is no affair of mine to try my own
thoughts, and to compare and estimate
statements, and to form some opinion of
my own upon the matter.<a name="FNanchor_2_40" id="FNanchor_2_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_40" class="fnanchor">2</a> And thus I
differ no whit from the grammarians. Who
was Hector&#8217;s father? <i>Priam.</i> And his
brothers? <i>Alexander and Deiphobus.</i> And
their mother, who was she? <i>Hecuba. That
is the account I have received.</i> From whom?
<i>From Homer; and I think Hellanicus has
written of them, and maybe others too.</i> And
I; what better have I to say about the
master-argument? But if I am a vain man,
and especially at a banquet, I shall amaze
all the company by recounting those who
have written on it;&mdash;for Chrysippus wrote
on it wonderfully in his first book &#8220;On
Possibilities;&#8221; and Cleanthes wrote a
separate treatise on it, and so did Archedemus.
And Antipater wrote too, not only
in his book &#8220;On Possibilities,&#8221; but also
separately in those on the master-argument.
Have you not read the work? No! Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
read it. And what good will it do him to
read it? He will become yet more of a
babbler and a nuisance than he is now, for
what else hath the reading of it done for
you? What opinion have you formed for
yourself on the matter? Nay, but you will
tell us all about Helen, and Priam, and the
island of Calypso, that never existed, nor
ever will.</p>

<p>3. And in Homer, indeed, it is no great
matter if you have simply mastered the
account, and formed no opinion of your
own. But in ethics this is even much
more often the case than in other matters.
Tell me concerning good and evil things!
Listen to him, then, with his&mdash;</p>

<div class="stanza">

</div>
</div>

<p><i>Of things some are good, some evil, and some
indifferent. Now the good things are the
virtues, and those that have the nature of
virtue, and the evil things the vices, and those
that have the nature of vice; and the indifferent
things<a name="FNanchor_3_41" id="FNanchor_3_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_41" class="fnanchor">3</a> are between these, as wealth, health,
life, death, pleasure, affliction.</i> And how do
you know this? Because Hellanicus affirms
it in his history of the Egyptians; for as
well say this as that Diogenes has it in his
Ethics, or Chrysippus, or Cleanthes. But
have you tested any of their sayings, and
formed an opinion for yourself? Show me
how you are wont to bear a storm at sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Do you remember the difference between
good and evil when the sail clatters, and
some vexatious man comes to you as you
are shrieking, and says&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Tell me, by the Gods, what you
were lately saying, Is it any vice to be shipwrecked?
Hath it anything of the nature
of vice?&#8221;</p>

<p>Would you not lay hold of a stick and
shake it in his face: <i>Let us alone, man; we
are perishing, and you come to mock us!</i> And
do you remember the difference if you are
accused of something and C&aelig;sar sends for
you? If one should come to you when you
enter, pale and trembling, and should say,
&#8220;Why do you tremble, man? what is your
business concerned with? Doth C&aelig;sar
there within dispense virtue and vice to
those who go in to him? <i>Why</i>, you will
say; <i>must you too mock me in my calamities?</i></p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Nevertheless, tell me, O Philosopher,
why you tremble&mdash;is it not merely
death that you are in danger of, or imprisonment,
or bodily suffering, or exile, or disgrace?
What else? Is it any vice? or
anything of the nature of vice?&#8221;</p>

<p>And you will reply somewhat to this
effect: <i>Let me alone, man; my own evils are
enough for me.</i></p>

<p>And truly you say well, for your own
evils are enough for you; which are meanness,
cowardice, and your false pretenses
when you sat in the school of philosophy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Why did you deck yourself in others&#8217; glory?
Why did you call yourself a Stoic?</p>

<p>4. Watch yourselves thus in the things
that ye do, and ye shall see of what school
ye are. And the most of you will be found
Epicureans, but some few Peripatetics,<a name="FNanchor_4_42" id="FNanchor_4_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_42" class="fnanchor">4</a> and
those but slack. For where is the proof
that ye hold virtue equal to all other things,
or indeed superior? Show me a Stoic, if
ye have one. Where or how can ye? But
persons that repeat the phrases of Stoicism,
of these ye can show us any number. And
do they repeat those of the Epicureans any
worse? and are they not equally accurate in
the Peripatetic? Who is, then, a Stoic? As
we say that a statue is Pheidian which is
wrought according to the art of Pheidias,
show me a man that is wrought according
to the opinions he utters! Show me one
that is sick and yet prosperous, in peril and
prosperous, dying and prosperous, in exile
and prosperous, in evil repute and prosperous.
Show him to me! by the Gods! fain
would I see a Stoic! And have ye none
that is fully wrought out; then show me at
least one that is in hand to be wrought&mdash;one
that even leaneth towards these things.
Do me this favor&mdash;grudge not an old man a
sight that I have never seen yet. Think ye
that I would have you show me the Zeus of
Pheidias or the Athene&mdash;a work all ivory
and gold? Nay; but let one show me a
man&#8217;s soul that longs to be like-minded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
with God, and to blame neither Gods nor
men, and not to fail in any effort or avoidance,
and not to be wrathful nor envious,
nor jealous, but&mdash;for why should I make
rounds to say it?&mdash;that desires to become a
God from a man, and in this body of ours,
this corpse, is mindful of his fellowship with
Zeus. Show me that man. But ye cannot!
Why, then, will ye mock yourselves and
cheat others? Why wrap yourselves in
others&#8217; garb, and go about, like thieves that
steal clothes from the bath, with names and
things that in nowise belong to you?</p>

<p>5. And now I am your teacher and ye are
being taught by me. And I have this aim&mdash;to
perfect you, that ye be unhindered, uncompelled,
unembarrassed, free, prosperous,
happy, looking unto God alone in all things
great and small. And ye are here to learn
these things, and to do them. And wherefore
do ye not finish the work, if ye have indeed
such an aim as behooves you, and if I,
besides the aim, have such ability as behooves
me? What is here lacking? When I see a
carpenter, and the wood lying beside him,
I look for some work. And now, here is
the carpenter, here is the wood&mdash;what is yet
lacking? Is the thing such as cannot be
taught? It can. Is it, then, not in our
power? Yea, this alone of all things is.
Wealth is not in our power, nor health, nor
repute, nor any other thing, save only the
right use of appearances. This alone is by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
nature unhindered; this alone is unembarrassed.
Wherefore, then, will ye not make
an end? Tell me the reason. For either
the fault lies in me, or in you, or in the
nature of the thing. But the thing itself
is possible, and indeed the only thing that
is in our power. It remains that I am to
blame, or else ye are; or, to speak more
truly, both of us. What will ye, then? Let
us at length begin to entertain such a purpose
among us, and let the past be past.
Only let us make a beginning: trust in me,
and ye shall see.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the game of life.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">This</span> above all is the task of Nature&mdash;to
bind and harmonize together the force of
the appearances of the Right and of the
Useful.</p>

<p>2. Things are indifferent, but the uses of
them are not indifferent. How, then, shall
one preserve at once both a steadfast and
tranquil mind, and also carefulness of
things, that he be not heedless or slovenly?
If he take the example of dice players. The
numbers are indifferent, the dice are indifferent.
How can I tell what may be
thrown up? But carefully and skillfully to
make use of what is thrown, that is where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
my proper business begins. And this is the
great task of life also, to discern things and
divide them, and say, &#8220;Outward things are
not in my power; to will is in my power.
Where shall I seek the Good, and where the
Evil? Within me&mdash;in all that is my own.&#8221;
But of all that is alien to thee call nothing
good nor evil, nor profitable nor hurtful, nor
any such term as these.</p>

<p>3. What then? should we be careless of
such things? In no wise. For this, again,
is a vice in the Will, and thus contrary to
Nature. But be at once careful, because the
use of things is not indifferent, and steadfast
and tranquil because the things themselves
are. For where there is aught that concerns
me, there none can hinder or compel
me; and in those things where I am hindered
or compelled the attainment is not in
my power, and is neither good nor evil;
but my use of the event is either evil or
good, and this is in my power. And hard it
is, indeed, to mingle and reconcile together
the carefulness of one whom outward things
affect, with the steadfastness of him who
regards them not. But impossible, it is not;
and if it is, it is impossible to be happy.</p>

<p>4. Give me one man that cares how he
shall do anything&mdash;that thinks not of the
gaining of the thing, but thinks of his own
energy.</p>

<p>5. Chrysippus, therefore, said well&mdash;&#8220;As
long as future things are hidden from me, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
hold always by whatever state is the most
favorable for gaining the things that are according
to Nature; for God Himself gave it
to me to make such choice. But if I knew
that it were now ordained for me to be sick,
I would even move to it of myself. For the
foot, too, if it had intelligence, would move
of itself to be mired.&#8221;</p>

<p>6. For to what end, think you, are ears of
corn produced? Is it not that they may
become dry and parched? And the reason
they are parched, is it not that they may be
reaped? for it is not to exist for themselves
alone that they come into the world. If,
then, they had perception would it be proper
for them to pray that they should never be
reaped? since never to be reaped is for ears
of corn a curse. So understand that for
men it is a curse not to die, just as not to
be ripened and not to be reaped. But we,
since we are both the things to be reaped
and are also conscious that we shall be
reaped, have indignation thereat. For we
know not what we are, nor have we studied
what concerns humanity as those that have
the care of horses study what concerns them.
But Chrysantas, when just about to smite
the enemy, forbore on hearing the trumpet
sounding his recall; so much better did it
seem to him to obey the commander&#8217;s order
than to do his own will. But of us not one
will follow with docility the summons even
of necessity, but weeping and groaning the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
things that we suffer, we suffer, calling them
our doom.<a name="FNanchor_1_43" id="FNanchor_1_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_43" class="fnanchor">1</a> What doom, man? If by doom
you mean that which is doomed to happen
to us, then we are doomed in all things. But
if only our afflictions are to be called doom,
then what affliction is it that that which has
come into being should perish? But we
perish by the sword, or the wheel, or the
sea, or the tile of a roof, or a tyrant. What
matters it by what road thou goest down
into Hades? they are all equal. But if thou
wilt hear the truth, the way the tyrant sends
thee is the shortest. Never did a tyrant cut
a man&#8217;s throat in six months, but a fever
will often be a year killing him. All these
things are but noise, and a clatter of empty
names.</p>

<p>7. But let us do as in setting out on a
voyage. What is it possible for me to do?
This&mdash;to choose the captain, crew, the day,
the opportunity. Then a tempest has burst
upon us; but what doth it concern me? I
have left nothing undone that was mine to
do; the problem is now another&#8217;s, to wit,
the captain&#8217;s. But now the ship is sinking!
and what have I to do? I do only what I
am able&mdash;drown without terror and screaming
and accusing of God, but knowing that
that which has come into being must also
perish. For I am no Immortal, but a man,
a part of the sum of things as an hour is of
the day. Like the hour, I must arrive, and,
like the hour, pass away. What, then, can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
it matter to me how I pass away&mdash;whether
by drowning or by a fever? for pass I
must, even by some such thing. Now, this
is what you shall see done by skillful ball-players.
None careth for the ball as it were
a thing good or bad; but only about throwing
it and catching it. In this, then, there
is rule, in this art, quickness, judgment: so
that I may fail of catching the ball, even if
I spread out my lap, and another, if I throw
it, may catch it. But if I am anxious and
nervous as I catch and throw, what kind of
play is this? how shall one be steady? how
shall he observe the order of the game?
One will call &#8220;Throw,&#8221; &#8220;Do not throw,&#8221;
and another, &#8220;You have thrown once.&#8221;
But this is strife and not play.</p>

<p>8. Thus Socrates knew how to play ball.
How? When he jested in the court of justice.
&#8220;Tell me, Anytus,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how
say you that I believe there is no God?
The D&aelig;mons, who are they, think you?
Are they not sons of God, or a mixed nature
between Gods and men?&#8221; And when this
was admitted&mdash;&#8220;Who, do you think, can
hold that mules exist, but not asses?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_2_44" id="FNanchor_2_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_44" class="fnanchor">2</a> And
thus he played with the ball. And what was
the ball that was there thrown about among
them? Life, chains, exile, a draught of poison,
to be torn from a wife, to leave children
orphans. These were the things among
them that they played withal; yet none the
less did he play, and flung the ball with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
proper grace and measure. And so should
we do also, having the carefulness of the
most zealous players, and yet indifference,
as were it merely about a ball.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">things are what they are.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Each</span> thing that allures the mind or
offers an advantage or is loved by you, remember
to speak of it as it is, from the
smallest things upward. If you love an
earthen jar, then think, <i>I love an earthen jar</i>,
for so shall you not be troubled when it
breaks. And when you kiss your little child,
or wife, think, <i>I kiss a mortal</i>; and so shall
you not be troubled when they die.</p>

<p>2. When you are about to take in hand
some action, bethink you what it is that you
are about to do. If you go to the bath, represent
to yourself all that takes place there&mdash;the
squirting of water, the slapping, the
scolding, the pilfering; and then shall you
take the matter in hand more safely, saying
straightway: <i>I desire to be bathed, and maintain
my purpose according to Nature.</i> And
even so with each and every action. For
thus, if aught should occur to cross you in
your bathing, this thought shall be straightway
at hand: <i>But not this alone did I desire;
but also to maintain my purpose according to</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
<i>Nature. And I shall not maintain it if I have
indignation at what happens here.</i></p>

<p>3. The first difference between the vulgar
man and the philosopher: The one saith,
<i>Woe is me for my child, my brother, woe
for my father</i>; but the other, if ever he shall
be compelled to say, <i>Woe is me</i>, checks himself,
and saith, <i>for myself</i>. For nothing that
the Will willeth not can hinder or hurt the
Will, but itself only can hurt itself. If then,
indeed, we too incline to this, that when we
are afflicted we accuse ourselves, and recollect
that nothing else than Opinion can
cause us any trouble or unsettlement,
I swear by all the Gods we have advanced!
But as it is, we have from the
beginning traveled a different road. While
we are still children, if haply we stumbled
as we were gaping about, the nurse did
not chide us, but beat the stone. For what
had the stone done? Ought it to have
moved out of the way for your child&#8217;s folly?
Again, if we find nothing to eat after coming
from the bath, never doth the tutor
check our desire, but he beats the cook.
Man, we did not set thee to be a tutor of
the cook, but of our child&mdash;him shall you
train, him improve. And thus, even when
full-grown, we appear as children. For a
child in music is he who hath not learned
music, and in letters, one who hath not
learned letters, and in life, one undisciplined
in philosophy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>4. It is not things, but the opinions about
the things, that trouble mankind. Thus
Death is nothing terrible; if it were so, it
would have appeared so to Socrates. But
the opinion we have about Death, that it is
terrible, <i>that</i> it is wherein the terror lieth.
When, therefore, we are hindered or troubled
or grieved, never let us blame any other than
ourselves; that is to say, our opinions. A
man undisciplined in philosophy blames
others in matters in which he fares ill; one
who begins to be disciplined blames himself,
one who is disciplined, neither others
nor himself.</p>

<p>5. Be not elated in mind at any superiority
that is not of yourself. If your horse were
elated and should say, <i>I am beautiful</i>, that
would be tolerable. But when you are elated
and say, <i>I have a beautiful horse</i>, know that
it is at an excellence in your horse that you
are elated. What, then, is your own? This&mdash;to
make use of the appearances. So that
when you deal according to Nature in the
use of appearances, then shall you be elated,
for you will then be elated at an excellence
that is your own.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">three steps to perfection.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">There</span> are three divisions of Philosophy
wherein a man must exercise himself who
would be wise and good.<a name="FNanchor_1_45" id="FNanchor_1_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_45" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>The first concerns his pursuit and avoidance,
so that he may not fail of aught that
he would attain, nor fall into aught that he
would avoid.</p>

<p>The second concerns his desires and
aversions, and, generally, all that it becomes
a man to be, so that he bear himself orderly
and prudently and not heedlessly.</p>

<p>The third is that which concerns security
from delusion and hasty apprehension, and,
generally, the assenting to appearances.</p>

<p>Of these the chief and most urgent is that
which hath to do with the passions,<a name="FNanchor_2_46" id="FNanchor_2_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_46" class="fnanchor">2</a> for the
passions arise in no other way than by our
failing in endeavor to attain or to avoid
something. This it is which brings in
troubles and tumults and ill-luck and misfortune,
that is the cause of griefs and lamentations
and envies, that makes envious and
jealous men; by which things we become
unable even to hear the doctrines of reason.</p>

<p>The second concerns that which is becoming
to a man; for I must not be passionless,<a name="FNanchor_2_46b" id="FNanchor_2_46b"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_46" class="fnanchor">2</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>

like a statue, but maintain all relations
natural and acquired, as a religious being,
as a son, as a brother, as a father, as a
citizen.</p>

<p>The third is that which concerns men as
soon as they are making advance in philosophy,
which provides for the security of the
two others; so that not even in dreams may
any appearance that approacheth us pass
untested, nor in wine, nor in ill-humors.
This, a man may say, is beyond us. But the
philosophers of this day, passing by the first
and second parts of philosophy, occupy
themselves in the third, caviling, and arguing
by questions, and constructing hypotheses
and fallacies. For, they say, when
dealing with these subjects a man must
guard himself from delusion. Who must?
The wise and good man.</p>

<p>2. And this security is all you lack, then;
the rest you have wrought out already?
You are not to be imposed upon by money?
and if you see a fair girl you can hold out
against the appearance? and if your neighbor
inherits a legacy you are not envious?
there is now, in short, nothing lacking to you
except to confirm what you have? Wretch!
these very things dost thou hear in fear and
anxiety lest some one may despise thee,
and inquiring what men say about thee.
And if some one come and tell you that
when it was discussed who was the best of
the philosophers, one present said, <i>Such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
one is the greatest philosopher</i>, your little
soul will grow up from a finger&#8217;s breadth to
two cubits. And if another who was present
said, <i>Nothing of the kind; it is not worth
while to listen to him; for what does he know?
he has made a beginning in philosophy and
no more</i>, you are amazed, you grow pale,
and straightway you cry out, <i>I will show
him who I am, that I am a great philosopher</i>.</p>

<p>Out of these very things it is seen what
you are; why do you desire to show it by
any others?</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">that a man may be both bold and fearful.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">To</span> some it may perchance seem a
paradox, this axiom of the philosophers; yet
let us make the best inquiry we can if it be
true that it is possible to do all things at once
with fearfulness and with boldness. For
fearfulness seemeth in a manner contrary to
boldness, and contraries can never co-exist.
But that which to many seemeth a paradox
in this matter seems to me to stand somehow
thus: If we affirmed that both fearfulness
and boldness could be used in the very
same things, they would justly accuse us that
we were reconciling what is irreconcilable.
But now, what is there so strange in this
saying? For if it is sound, what hath been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
so often both affirmed and demonstrated,
that the essence of the Good is in the use of
appearances, and even so of the Evil, and
things uncontrollable by the Will have the
nature neither of good nor of evil, what
paradox do the philosophers affirm if they
say that in things uncontrollable by the Will,
then be boldness thy part, and in things
subject to the Will, fearfulness. For if Evil
lie in an evil Will, then in these things alone
is it right to use fearfulness. And if things
uncontrollable by the Will, and that are not
in our power, are nothing to us, then in these
things we should use boldness. And thus
shall we be at one time both fearful and bold&mdash;yea,
and bold even through our fearfulness.
For through being fearful in things that are
veritably evil it comes that we shall be bold
in those that are not so.</p>

<p>2. But we, on the contrary, fall victims as
deer do. When these are terrified and fly
from the scares, whither do they turn and to
what do they retreat as a refuge? To the
nets: and thus they perish, confusing things
to fear and things to be bold about. And
thus do we also. Where do we employ fear?
In things beyond our Will. And wherein
do we act boldly, as were there nothing to
dread? In things subject to the Will. To
be beguiled, then, or to be rash, or to do
some shameless act, or with base greed to
pursue some object&mdash;these things concern
us no whit if we may only hit the mark in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
things beyond the Will. But where death
is, or exile, or suffering, or evil repute, there
we run away, there we are scared. Therefore,
as it were to be looked for in those
who are astray in the things of greatest
moment, we work out our natural boldness
into swaggering, abandonment, rashness,
shamelessness; and our natural fearfulness
and shamefastness into cowardice and
meanness, full of terror and trouble. For if
one should transfer his fearfulness to the
realm of the Will, and the works thereof,
straightway, together with the intention of
fearing to do wrong, he shall have it in his
power to avoid doing it; but if he use it in
things out of our own power and beyond
the Will, then striving to avoid things that
are in others&#8217; power, he shall of necessity be
terrified and unsettled and troubled. For
death is not fearful, nor pain, but the fear of
pain or death. And thus we praise him<a name="FNanchor_1_47" id="FNanchor_1_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_47" class="fnanchor">1</a>
who said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Fear not to die, but fear a coward&#8217;s death.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>3. It is right, then, that we should turn
our boldness against death, and our fearfulness
against the fear of death. But now we
do the contrary: death we flee from, but as
to the state of our opinion about death we
are negligent, heedless, indifferent. These
things Socrates did well to call bugbears.
For as to children, through their inexpe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>rience,
ugly masks appear terrible and fearful;
so we are somewhat in the same way
moved towards the affairs of life, for no
other cause than as children are affected by
these bugbears. For what is a child? Ignorance.
What is a child? That which has
never learned. For when he knows these
things he is nowise inferior to us. What is
death? A bugbear. Turn it round; examine
it: see, it does not bite. Now or
later that which is body must be parted from
that which is spirit, as formerly it was
parted. Why, then, hast thou indignation
if it be now? for if it be not now, it will be
later. And wherefore? That the cycle of
the world may be fulfilled; for it hath need
of a present and of a future and of a past.
What is pain? A bugbear. Turn it about
and examine it. This poor body is moved
harshly, then again softly. If thou hast no
advantage thereof, the door is open;<a name="FNanchor_2_48" id="FNanchor_2_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_48" class="fnanchor">2</a> if thou
hast, then bear it. For in all events it is
right that the door should stand open, and
so have we no distress.</p>

<p>4. Shall I, then, exist no longer? Nay,
thou shalt exist, but as something else,
whereof the universe hath now need.<a name="FNanchor_3_49" id="FNanchor_3_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_49" class="fnanchor">3</a> For
neither didst thou choose thine own time to
come into existence, but when the universe
had need of thee.</p>

<p>5. What, then, is the fruit of these opinions?
That which ought to be the fairest
and comeliest to those who have been truly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
taught,&mdash;tranquillity, courage, and freedom.
For concerning these things, the multitude
are not to be believed which say that those
only should be taught who are freemen,
but the philosophers rather, which say that
those only are free who have been taught.
How is this? It is thus&mdash;Is freedom anything
else than the power to live as we
choose? <i>Nothing else.</i> Do ye choose,
then, to live in sin? <i>We do not choose it.</i>
None, therefore, that fears or grieves or is
anxious is free; but whosoever is released
from griefs and fears and anxieties is by
that very thing released from slavery.
How, then, shall we still believe you, most
excellent legislators, when ye say, &#8220;We
permit none to be taught, save freemen?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_4_50" id="FNanchor_4_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_50" class="fnanchor">4</a>
for the philosophers say, &#8220;We permit none to
be free save those who have been taught&#8221;&mdash;that
is, God permits it not. <i>So, when a
man turns round his slave before the Pr&aelig;tor,<a name="FNanchor_5_51" id="FNanchor_5_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_51" class="fnanchor">5</a>
has he done nothing?</i> He has done something.
<i>And what?</i> He has turned round
his slave before the Pr&aelig;tor. <i>Nothing else at
all?</i> Yea, this too&mdash;he must pay for him
the tax of the twentieth. <i>What then? has
the man thus treated not gained his freedom?</i>
No more than he has gained tranquillity of
mind. For thou, who art able to emancipate
others, hast thou no master? is money
not thy master, or lust, or a tyrant, or some
friend of a tyrant? Why, then, dost thou
tremble when thou art to meet with some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
affliction in this kind? And therefore I say
oftentimes, be these things your study, be
these things ever at your hand, wherein ye
should be bold and wherein fearful; bold in
things beyond the Will, fearful in things
subject to the Will.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER VI.<a name="FNanchor_1_52" id="FNanchor_1_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_52" class="fnanchor">1</a></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the wise man&#8217;s fear and the fool&#8217;s.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> appearances by which the mind of
man is smitten with the first aspect of a
thing as it approaches the soul, are not matters
of the will, nor can we control them;
but by a certain force of their own the objects
which we have to comprehend are borne
in upon us. But that ratification of them,
which we name assent, whereby the appearances
are comprehended and judged, these
are voluntary, and are done by human
choice. Wherefore at a sound from the
heavens, or from the downfall of something,
or some signal of danger, or anything else
of this kind, it must needs be that the soul
of the philosopher too shall be somewhat
moved, and he shall shrink and grow pale;
not through any opinion of evil that he has
formed, but through certain rapid and unconsidered
motions that forestall the office
of the mind and reason. Soon, however,
that philosopher doth not approve the ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>pearances
to be truly objects of terror to his
soul, that is to say, he assents not to them
nor ratifies them; but he rejects them, and
casts them out; nor doth there seem to be
in them anything that he should fear. But
in this, say the philosophers, doth the wise
man differ from the fool,&mdash;that the fool
thinks the appearances to be in truth even
so harsh and rough as they seemed at their
first shock upon the soul; and taking them,
as at first, to be rightly dreaded, he thus
ratifies and approves them by his assent.
The philosopher, however, though for a
short time his color and countenance have
been changed, doth not then assent, but he
retains in its steadfastness and vigor the
opinion he ever had of these appearances,
that they are in no wise to be feared, but
affright only by a false show and empty
threat.</p>

<p>2. Such as is a dish of water, such is the
soul; such as is the ray of light that falleth
on the same, such are the appearances.
When the water is moved, then the ray
seemeth also to be moved; but it is not
moved. And thus when a man&#8217;s mind is
darkened and dizzy, it is not doctrines and
virtues that are confounded, but the spirit
on which they are impressed. And if that
is restored, so are they.<a name="FNanchor_2_53" id="FNanchor_2_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_53" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">appearances false and true.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Appearances</span> exist for us in four ways.
Either things appear even as they are; or
having no existence, neither do they appear
to have it; or they exist, and appear not; or
they exist not, and yet appear. So, in all
these cases, to hit the mark is the work of
him who hath been taught in philosophy.</p>

<p>2. But whatever it be that afflicts us, it is
to that thing that the remedy is to be applied.
If it is the sophisms of the Pyrrhonists and
Academics<a name="FNanchor_1_54" id="FNanchor_1_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_54" class="fnanchor">1</a> that afflict us, to them let us
apply the remedy. If it is the delusiveness
of things, whereby that appeareth to be
good which is not so, to that let us seek for
the remedy. If a habit afflicts us, against
that must we endeavor to find some remedy.
And what remedy is to be found against a
habit? The contrary habit. Thou hearest
the ignorant when they say, <i>The wretched
man is dead; his father is perishing with
grief for him, or his mother; he was cut off,
yea, and untimely, and in a strange land</i>.
Hearken, then, to the contrary words. Tear
thyself away from such utterances. Against
habit set the contrary habit. Against the
words of the Sophists have the maxims of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
philosophers and the exercise and constant
usage of them; against the delusiveness of
things have clear natural conceptions ever
burnished and ready.</p>

<p>3. Whenever death may appear to be an
evil, have ready the thought that it is right
to avoid evils, and that death is unavoidable.
For what shall I do? whither shall I flee
from it? Let it be granted that I am no
Sarpedon, son of Zeus, to speak in that lofty
style: <i>I go either to do great deeds myself, or
to give another the chance of doing them;
though I myself fail I shall not grudge it to
another to do nobly</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_55" id="FNanchor_2_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_55" class="fnanchor">2</a> Let it be granted that
this is above us; still can we not at least
rise to the height of that? And whither
shall I flee from death? declare to me the
place; declare to me the men among whom
I shall go, to whom death comes never near;
declare to me the charms against it. If I
have none, what would ye have me do? I
cannot escape death&mdash;shall I not then escape
the fear of death? shall I die lamenting and
trembling? In this is the source of suffering,
to wish for something, and that it should
not come to pass; and thence it is that when
I am able to alter outward things at my
desire, I do so, but when not, I am ready to
tear out the eyes of him that hindereth me.
For man is so made by nature that he will
not bear to be deprived of the Good nor to
fall into the Evil. And in the end, when I
am neither able to alter outward things nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
to tear out the eyes of him that hindereth
me, I sit down and groan and rail on whomsoever
I can, Zeus and the other Gods;&mdash;for
if they neglect me, what have I to do with
them? <i>Yea, but thou wilt be an impious man.</i>
And how shall I be worse off than I am
now? Here is the whole matter: Remember
that unless religion and profit meet in
the same thing, religion cannot be saved in
any man. Do not these things mightily
convince of their truth?</p>

<p>4. Let the Pyrrhonist and the Academic
come and make their attack&mdash;I, for my part,
have no leisure for such discussions, nor am
I able to argue in defense of general consent.<a name="FNanchor_3_56" id="FNanchor_3_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_56" class="fnanchor">3</a>
For if I had a suit about a little piece
of land, would I not call in another to argue
for me? Wherewith shall I be satisfied?
With that which concerns the matter in
hand. How perception takes place, whether
by the whole man or by parts, perhaps I
know not how to declare: both opinions
perplex me. But that thou and I are not
the same I know very clearly. <i>Whence
know you this?</i> Never, when I wish to eat,
do I carry the morsel to another man&#8217;s mouth,
but to my own. Never, when I wish to
take a piece of bread, do I lay hold of a
broom, but I always go to the bread, as to
a mark. And ye who deny the truth of
perception, what do ye other than I? Which
of you, desiring to go to the bath, ever went
into a mill? <i>What then? Ought we not,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
according to our abilities, to busy ourselves with
the upholding of general consent, and raising
defenses against all that opposeth the same?</i>
And who denies it? But let him do it that
can, that hath leisure; but he that trembleth,
and is troubled, and his heart is broken within
him, let him spend his time on something
different.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">how we should think as god&#8217;s offspring.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">If</span> those things are true which are said
by philosophers concerning the kinship of
God and men, what else remains for men to
do than after Socrates&#8217; way, who never,
when men inquired of him what was his
native country, replied <i>Athens</i> or <i>Corinth</i>,
but <i>the universe</i>. For why wilt thou say
thou art an Athenian, and not rather name
thyself from that nook alone into which thy
wretched body was cast at birth? Is it not
plainly from the lordlier place, and that
which contains not only that nook and all
thy household, but also the whole land
whence the race of thy ancestors has come
down even to thee, that thou callest thyself
Athenian or Corinthian? Whoso, therefore,
hath watched the governance of the universe,
and hath learned that the greatest and
mightiest and amplest of all societies is that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
which is composed of mankind and of God;
and that from Him have descended the
seeds not only to my father alone, nor to
my grandfather, but to all creatures that are
conceived and born upon the earth (but especially
to reasoning beings, since to these
alone hath nature given it to have communion
and intercourse with God, being linked
with Him through Reason),&mdash;wherefore
should such a one not name himself a
citizen of the universe? wherefore not a
son of God? wherefore shall he fear
anything that may come to pass among
men? And shall kinship with C&aelig;sar,
or with some other of those that are
mighty at Rome, be enough to let us live in
safety and undespised and fearing nothing
at all; but to have God for our maker and
father and guardian, shall this not avail to
deliver us from griefs and fears?</p>

<p><i>But I have no money</i>, saith one; <i>whence
shall I have bread to eat?</i></p>

<p>2. Art thou not ashamed to be more
cowardly and spiritless than fugitive slaves
are? How do they leave their masters
when they run away? in what estates do
they put their trust? in what servants?
After stealing a little to serve them for the
first few days, do they not afterwards
journey by land and sea, and make their
living by one device after another? And
when did ever any fugitive slave die of
hunger? But thou tremblest and sleepest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
not of nights, for fear lest the necessaries of
life fail thee. Wretched man! art thou thus
blind? and seest not the road whither the
want of necessaries leads a man? And
whither leads it? To the same place that
a fever doth, or a falling rock&mdash;to death.
Hast thou not often said this to thy friends?
and often read aloud these things, and
written them? and how often hast thou
vaunted thyself that thou wert at peace
about death? <i>Yea, but my dear ones shall
also suffer hunger.</i> What then? Doth their
hunger lead to any other place than thine?
Do they not descend where thou descendest?
Is there not one underworld for them and
thee? Wilt thou not, then, be bold in all
poverty and need, looking to that place
whither the wealthiest of men, and the
mightiest governors, yea, and even kings
and tyrants, must go down; thou, it may
be, an-hungered, and they bursting with
indigestion and drunkenness?</p>

<p>How seldom is it that a beggar is seen
that is not an old man, and even of exceeding
age? but freezing by night and day, and
lying on the ground, and eating only what
is barely necessary, they come near to being
unable to die. Canst thou not transcribe
writings? canst thou not teach children? or
be some man&#8217;s door-keeper?</p>

<p><i>But it is shameful to come to such a
necessity!</i></p>

<p>Then first of all learn what things are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
shameful, and afterwards tell us thou art a
philosopher. But at present suffer not even
another man to call thee so.</p>

<p>3. Is that shameful to thee which is not
thine own doing, whereof thou art not the
cause, which cometh to thee without thy
will, like a headache or a fever? If thy
parents were poor, or made others their
heirs, or are alive and give thee nothing,
are these things shameful to thee? Is this
what thou hast learnt from the philosophers?
Hast thou never heard that what is shameful
is blamable; and that which is blamable
ought to be blamed? But what man wilt
thou blame for a work not his own, one
that he himself never did! And didst thou
make thy father such as he is? or was it in
thy power to correct him?&mdash;is it given thee
to do this? What then? Oughtest thou to
desire what is not given to thee? or to be
ashamed if thou attain it not? Or hast thou
been accustomed, in philosophy, to look to
others, and to hope for nothing from thyself?
Lament, therefore, and groan, and
eat thy bread in fear, lest thou have nothing
to eat on the morrow. Tremble for thy
slaves, lest they steal, or run away, or die.
Do thou live thus, now and ever, who hast
approached to the name only of philosophy,
and hast brought the precepts of it to shame,
so far as in thee lies, showing them to be
worthless and useless to those who adopt
them; thou, who hast never striven to gain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
steadfastness, tranquillity, peace; that never
waited upon any man for the sake of these
things, but upon many for the sake of
learning syllogisms; that never tested for
thine own self any one of these appearances:&mdash;<i>Am
I able to bear it, or am I not able?
What, then, remains for me to do?</i> But, as
though all went fairly and safely with thee,
thou abidest in the final part of philosophy,<a name="FNanchor_1_57" id="FNanchor_1_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_57" class="fnanchor">1</a>
that which confirms beyond all change&mdash;and
wherein wilt thou be confirmed? in
cowardice, meanness, admiration of wealth,
in vain pursuit, and vain efforts to avoid?
These are the things thou dost meditate how
to preserve unharmed.</p>

<p>4. Shouldst thou not first have gained
something from Reason, and then fortified
this with safety? Whom sawest thou ever
building a coping round about, and never a
wall on which to place it? And what door-keeper
is set on guard where there is no
door? But thy study is how to prove propositions&mdash;and
<i>what</i> proposition? How the
billows of false reasonings may sweep thee
not away&mdash;and away from <i>what</i>? Show
me first what thing thou art guarding, or
measuring, or weighing; and afterwards
the scales or the measuring-rod. Or how
long wilt thou still be measuring the dust?
Are not these the things it behooves thee to
prove:&mdash;what it is that makes men happy,
what makes things proceed as we would
have them, how one should blame no man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
accuse no man, and fit one&#8217;s self to the ordering
of the All? Yea, prove me these!
<i>But I do so</i>, he saith. <i>See! I resolve you syllogisms.</i>
Slave! this is the measuring-rod&mdash;it
is not the thing measured. Wherefore
now you pay the penalty for philosophy
neglected; you tremble, you lie awake at
nights, you seek counsel on every hand, and
if the counsels are not pleasing to all men
you think they were ill-counseled.</p>

<p>5. Then you fear hunger, as you suppose.
But it is not hunger that you fear&mdash;you fear
you will have no cook, nor nobody else to
buy victuals for you, nor another to take off
your boots, nor another to put them on, nor
others to rub you down, nor others to follow
you about, so that when you have stripped
yourself in the bath, and stretched yourself
out as if you were crucified, you may be
rubbed to and fro, and then the rubber
standing by may say, <i>Turn him round, give
me his side, take hold of his head, let me
have his shoulder</i>; and then when you leave
the bath and go home you may shout,
<i>Is no one bringing anything to eat?</i> and then,
<i>Take away the plates, and wipe them</i>. This
is what you fear,&mdash;lest you be not able to
live like a sick man. But learn how those
live that are in health&mdash;slaves, and laborers,
and true philosophers; how Socrates lived,
who moreover had a wife and children; how
Diogenes lived; how Cleanthes that studied
in the schools and drew his own water.<a name="FNanchor_2_58" id="FNanchor_2_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_58" class="fnanchor">2</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
If you would have these things, they are
everywhere to be had, and you will live
boldly. Bold in what? In that wherein
alone it is possible to be bold&mdash;in that which
is faithful, which cannot be hindered, which
cannot be taken away. But why hast thou
made thyself so worthless and useless that
no one is willing to receive thee into his
house or take care of thee? But if any
utensil were thrown away, and it was sound
and serviceable, every one that found it
would pick it up and think it a gain; but
thee no man would pick up, nor count anything
but damage. So thou canst not so
much as serve the purpose of a watch-dog,
or a cock? Why, then, wilt thou still
live, being such a man as thou art?</p>

<p>6. Doth any good man fear lest the means
of gaining food fail him? They fail not the
blind, nor the lame; shall they fail a good
man? To the good soldier there fails not
one who gives him pay, nor to the laborer,
nor to the shoemaker; and shall such a one
fail to the good man? Is God, then, careless
of His instruments, His servants, His
witnesses, whom alone He useth to show
forth to the untaught what He is, and that
He governs all things well, and is not careless
of human things? and that to a good
man there is no evil, neither in life nor in
death? <i>How, then, when He leaves them without
food?</i> How else is this than as when a
good general gives me the signal for retreat?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
I obey, I follow, praising my leader and
hymning his works. For I came when it
pleased him, and when it pleases him I will
go. In my lifetime also my work was to
sing the praise of God, both alone to myself,
and to single persons, and in presence of
many. He doth not provide me with many
things, nor with great abundance of goods;
He will not have me live delicately. For
neither did He provide so for Hercules, His
own son, but another man reigned over
Argos and Mycen&aelig;, while he obeyed and
labored and was disciplined. And Eurystheus
was what he was&mdash;no king of Argos
and Mycen&aelig;, who was not king even of
himself; and Hercules was lord and leader
of all the earth and sea, for he purged them
of lawlessness and wrong, and brought
in righteousness and holiness; naked and
alone did he this. And when Odysseus was
shipwrecked and cast away, did his need
humble him one whit or break his spirit?
But how did he go out to the maidens, to
beg for the necessaries of life, which it is
held most shameful to seek from another?</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;Even as a lion from his mountain home,</span>
<span class="i0">So went Odysseus trusting in his valor.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i10">&mdash;<i>Odyssey</i>, vi. 130.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Trusting in what? Not in fame, nor wealth,
but in his own valor&mdash;that is, his opinions
of the things that are and are not in our
power.<a name="FNanchor_3_59" id="FNanchor_3_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_59" class="fnanchor">3</a> For these alone it is that make men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
free and unhindered; that lift up the heads
of the abject, and bid them look rich men
and tyrants steadily in the face. And this
was the gift of the philosopher; but thou
wilt never go forth boldly, but trembling
for thy fine raiment and silver dishes. Miserable
man! hast thou indeed thus wasted
all thy time till now?</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the open door.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">For</span> my part I think the old man should
be sitting here, not to devise how ye may
have no mean thoughts, nor speak no mean
nor ignoble things about yourselves, but to
watch that there arise not among us youths
of such a mind, that when they have perceived
their kinship with the Gods, and how
the flesh and its possessions are laid upon
us like bonds, and how many necessities
for the management of life are by them
brought upon us, they may desire to fling
these things away for abhorred and intolerable
burthens, and depart unto their kin.
And this is what your master and teacher&mdash;if,
in sooth, ye had any such&mdash;should
have to contend with in you,&mdash;that ye
should come to him and say, <i>Epictetus, we
can endure no longer being bound to this body,
giving it food and drink, and resting it and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
cleansing it, and going about to court one man
after another for its sake. Are not such things
indifferent and nothing to us? And is not
Death no evil? Are we not in some way
kinsmen of God, and did we not come from
Him? Let us depart to whence we came; let
us be delivered at last from these bonds wherewith
we are bound and burthened! Here are
robbers, and thieves, and law courts, and those
that are called tyrants, which through the body
and its possessions seem as if they had some
power over us. Let us show them that they
have no power over any man!</i> And to this
it should be my part to say, &#8220;My friends,
wait upon God. When He Himself shall
give the signal and release you from this
service, then are ye released unto Him.
But for the present, bear to dwell in this
place, wherein He has set you. Short, indeed,
is this time of your sojourn, and easy
to bear for those that are so minded. For
what tyrant or what thief is there any
longer, or what court of law is terrible to
one who thus makes nothing of the body
and the possessions of it? Remain, then,
and depart not without a reason.&#8221; Some
such part as this should the teacher have to
play towards the well-natured among his
disciples.</p>

<p>2. How long, then, are such injunctions
to be obeyed? So long as it is profitable&mdash;that
is to say, so long as I can do what becomes
and befits me. Then some men are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
choleric and fastidious, and say, &#8220;I cannot
sup with this man, to have to hear him every
day telling how he fought in Mysia.&#8221; <i>I told
you, brother, how I went up the hill&mdash;then
again I began to be besieged</i>.... But another
saith, &#8220;I prefer to have my supper,
and listen to him prating as long as he likes.&#8221;
And do thou compare the gain on both sides&mdash;only
do naught in heaviness or affliction,
or as supposing that thou art in evil case.
For to this no man can compel thee. Doth
it smoke in the chamber? if it is not very
much I will stay, if too much, I will go out;
for remember this always, and hold fast to
it, that the door is open. <i>Thou shalt not live
in Nicopolis.</i> I will not. <i>Nor in Athens.</i> I
will not live in Athens. <i>Nor in Rome.</i>
Neither in Rome. <i>Live in Gyara.</i><a name="FNanchor_1_60" id="FNanchor_1_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_60" class="fnanchor">1</a> I will
live in Gyara. But living in Gyara seemeth
to me like a great smoke. I will depart,
whither no man shall hinder me to dwell&mdash;for
that dwelling stands ever open to all.</p>

<p>3. Only do it not unreasonably, nor
cowardly, nor make every common chance
an excuse. For again, it is not God&#8217;s will,
for He hath need of such an order of things,
and of such a race upon the earth. But if
He give the signal for retreat, as He did to
Socrates, we must obey Him as our commander.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER X.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">know thyself.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">If</span> a man have any advantage over
others, or thinks himself to have it when he
hath it not, it cannot but be that if he is an
untaught man he shall be puffed up by it.
Thus the tyrant says, <i>I am he that is master
of all</i>. And what can you give me? Can
you set my pursuit free of all hindrance?
How is it in you to do that? For have you
the gift of never falling into what you shun?
or never missing the mark of your desire?
And whence have you it? Come, now, in a
ship do you trust to yourself or to the captain?
or in a chariot, to any one else than
the driver?<a name="FNanchor_1_61" id="FNanchor_1_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_61" class="fnanchor">1</a> And how will you do with regard
to other acts? Even thus. Where,
then, is your power? <i>All men minister to
me.</i> And do I not minister to my plate, and
I wash it and wipe it, and drive in a peg for
my oil-flask? What then, are these things
greater than I? Nay, but they supply certain
of my needs, and for this reason I take
care of them. Yea, and do I not minister to
my ass? Do I not wash his feet and groom
him? Know you not that every man ministers
to himself? And he ministers to you
also, even as he doth to the ass. For who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
treats you as a man? Show me one that
doth. Who wisheth to be like unto you?
who becomes your imitator, as men did of
Socrates? <i>But I can cut off thy head.</i> You
say well. I had forgotten that I must pay
regard to you as to a fever or the cholera;
and set up an altar to you, as there is in
Rome an altar to Fever.</p>

<p>2. What is it, then, whereby the multitude
is troubled and terrified? The tyrant and
his guards? Never&mdash;God forbid it! It is
not possible that that which is by nature free
should be troubled by any other thing, or
hindered, save by itself. But it is troubled
by opinions of things. For when the tyrant
saith to any one, <i>I will bind thy leg</i>, then he
who setteth store by his leg saith, <i>Nay, have
pity!</i> but he that setteth store by his own
Will, <i>If it seem more profitable to you, then
bind it</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Dost thou not regard me?&#8221;</p>

<p>I do not regard you. I will show you
that I am master. How can you be that?
Me hath God set free; or think you that He
would let His own Son be enslaved? You
are lord of my dead body&mdash;take that.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;So when thou comest near to me,
thou wilt not do me service?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nay, but I will do it to myself; and if you
will have me say that I do it to you also, I
tell you that I do it as to my kitchen pot.</p>

<p>3. This is no selfishness; for every living
creature is so made that it doth all things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
for its own sake. For the sun doth all things
for his own sake, and so, moreover, even
Zeus himself. But when He will be Raingiver
and Fruitgiver and Father of Gods and
men, thou seest that He may not do these
works and have these titles, but He be serviceable
to the common good. And, on the
whole, He hath so formed the nature of the
reasoning creature that he may never win
aught of his own good without he furnish
something of service to the common good.
Thus it is not to the excluding of the common
good that a man do all things for himself.
For is it to be expected that a man
shall stand aloof from himself and his own
interest? And where then would be that
same and single principle which we observe
in all things, their affection to themselves?</p>

<p>4. So, then, when we act on strange and
foolish opinions of things beyond the Will,
as though they were good or evil, it is altogether
impossible but we shall do service to
tyrants. And would it were to the tyrants
alone, and not to their lackeys also!</p>

<p>5. But what hinders the man that hath
distinguished these things to live easily and
docile, looking calmly on all that is to be,
and bearing calmly all that is past? Will
you have me bear poverty? Come, and see
what poverty is when it strikes one that
knoweth how to play the part well. Will
you have me rule? Give me power, then,
and the pains of it. Banishment? Whith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>ersoever
I go, it shall be well with me
for in this place it was well with me, not
because of the place, but because of the
opinions which I shall carry away with me.
For these no man can deprive me of. Yea,
these only are mine own, whereof I cannot
be deprived, and they suffice for me as long
as I have them, wherever I be, or whatever
I do.</p>

<p>6. &mdash;&mdash;&#8220;But now is the time come to
die.&#8221;</p>

<p>What say you? to die? Nay, make no
tragedy of the business, but tell it as it is.
Now is it time for my substance to be resolved
again into the things wherefrom it
came together. And what is dreadful in
this? What of the things in the universe is
about to perish? What new, or what unaccountable
thing is about to come to pass?
Is it for these things that a tyrant is feared?
through these that the guards seem to bear
swords so large and sharp? Tell that to
others; but by me all these things have been
examined; no man hath power on me. I
have been set free by God, I know His commandments,
henceforth no man can lead
me captive. I have a liberator<a name="FNanchor_2_62" id="FNanchor_2_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_62" class="fnanchor">2</a> such as I
need, and judges such as I need. Are you
not the master of my body? What is that
to me? Of my property? What is that to
me? Of exile or captivity? Again, I say,
from all these things, and the poor body
itself, I will depart when you will. Try your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
power, and you shall know how far it
reaches.</p>

<p>7. But the tyrant will bind&mdash;what? The
leg. He will take away&mdash;what? The head.
What, then, can he not bind and not take
away? The Will. And hence that precept
of the ancients&mdash;<span class="smcap">Know Thyself</span>.</p>

<p>8. Whom, then, can I still fear? The
lackeys of the bed-chamber? For what that
they can do? Shut me out? Let them
shut me out, if they find me wishing to
go in.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Why, then, didst thou go to the
doors?&#8221;</p>

<p>Because I hold it proper to join the play
while the play lasts.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;How, then, shalt thou not be shut
out?&#8221;</p>

<p>Because if I am not received, I do not
wish to enter; but always that which happens
is what I wish. For I hold what God
wills above what I will. I cleave to Him
as His servant and follower; my impulses
are one with His, my pursuit is one with
His; in a word, my will is one with His.
There is no shutting out for me&mdash;nay, but
for those who would force their way in.
And wherefore do I not force my way?
Because I know that no good thing is dealt
out within to those that enter. But when I
hear some one congratulated on being honored
by C&aelig;sar, I say, What hath fortune
brought him? A government? Has it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
also, then, brought him such an opinion as
he ought to have? A magistracy? Hath
he also gained the power to be a good magistrate?
Why will I still push myself forward?
A man scatters figs and almonds
abroad; children seize them, and fight
among themselves; but not so men, for
they hold it too trifling a matter. And if a
man should scatter about oyster-shells, not
even the children would seize them. Offices
of government are dealt out&mdash;children will
look for them; money is given&mdash;children
will look for it; military commands, consulships&mdash;let
children scramble for them.
Let them be shut out and smitten, let them
kiss the hands of the giver, of his slaves&mdash;it
is figs and almonds to me. What then? If
thou miss them when he is flinging them
about, let it not vex thee. If a fig fall into
thy bosom, take and eat it, for so far even
a fig is to be valued. But if I must stoop
down for it, and throw down another man,
or another throw me down, and I flatter
those who enter in, then neither is a fig
worth so much, nor is any other of the things
that are not good, even those which the
philosophers have persuaded me not to think
good.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XI.<a name="FNanchor_1_63" id="FNanchor_1_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_63" class="fnanchor">1</a></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">how we should bear ourselves towards evil
men.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">If</span> that which the philosophers say is
true&mdash;that there is one principle in all men,
as when I assent to something, the feeling
that it is so; and when I dissent, the feeling
that it is not so; yea, and when I withhold
my judgment, the feeling that it is uncertain;
and likewise, when I am moved towards
anything, the feeling that it is for my
profit, but it is impossible to judge one thing
to be profitable and to pursue another, to
judge one thing right and be moved towards
another&mdash;why have we indignation with the
multitude? <i>They are robbers</i>, one saith, <i>and
thieves</i>. And what is it to be robbers and
thieves? It is to err concerning things good
and evil. Shall we, then, have indignation
with them, or shall we pity them? Nay,
but show them the error, and you shall see
how they will cease from their sins. But if
they see it not, they have naught better than
the appearance of the thing to them.</p>

<p>2. <i>Should not, then, this robber, or this
adulterer, be destroyed?</i> By no means, but
take it rather this way: <i>This man who errs
and is deceived concerning things of greatest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
moment, who is blinded, not in the vision
which distinguisheth black and white, but in
the judgment which distinguisheth Good and
Evil&mdash;should we not destroy him?</i> And thus
speaking, you shall know how inhuman
is that which you say, and how like as if
you said, <i>Shall we not destroy this blind
man, this deaf man?</i> For if it is the greatest
injury to be deprived of the greatest
things, and the greatest thing in every man
is a Will such as he ought to have, and one
be deprived of this, why are you still indignant
with him? Man, you should not be
moved contrary to Nature by the evil deeds
of other men. Pity him rather, be not inclined
to offense and hatred, abandon the
phrases of the multitude, like &#8220;these cursed
wretches.&#8221; How have you suddenly become
so wise and hard to please?</p>

<p>3. Wherefore, then, have we indignation?
Because we worship the things which they
deprive us of. Do not worship fine raiment,
and you shall not be wroth with the thief.
Do not worship the beauty of a woman,
and you shall not be wroth with the adulterer.
Know that the thief and the adulterer have
no part in that which is thine own, but in
that which is foreign to thee, in that which
is not in thy power. These things if thou
dismiss, and count them for naught, with
whom shalt thou still be wroth? But so
long as thou dost value these things, be
wroth with thyself rather than with others.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>4. Look now how it stands: You have fine
raiment, your neighbor has not; you have
a window, and wish to air your clothes at
it. The neighbor knoweth not what is the
true good of man, but thinks it is to have
fine raiment, the same thing that you also
think. Then shall he not come and take
them away? Show a cake to greedy persons,
and eat it up yourself alone, and will
you have them not snatch at it? Nay, but
provoke them not. Have no window, and
do not air your clothes. I also had lately
an iron lamp set beside the images of the
Gods; hearing a noise at the door, I ran
down, and found the lamp carried off. I
reflected that the thief&#8217;s impulse was not
unnatural. What then? <i>To-morrow</i>, I said,
<i>thou wilt find an earthen lamp</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_64" id="FNanchor_2_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_64" class="fnanchor">2</a> For a man
loses only what he has. <i>I have lost a garment.</i>
For you had a garment. <i>I have a
pain in my head.</i> Have you any pain in
your horns? Why, then, have you indignation?
For there is no loss and no suffering
save only in those things which we possess.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the voyage of life.</span></h4>

<p>Even as in a sea voyage, when the ship is
brought to anchor, and you go out to fetch
in water, you make a by-work of gathering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
a few roots and shells by the way, but have
need ever to keep your mind fixed on the
ship, and constantly to look round, lest at
any time the master of the ship call, and you
must, if he call, cast away all those things,
lest you be treated like the sheep that are
bound and thrown into the hold: So it is
with human life also. And if there be given
wife and children instead of shells and roots,
nothing shall hinder us to take them. But
if the master call, run to the ship, forsaking
all those things, and looking not behind.
And if thou be in old age, go not far from
the ship at any time, lest the master should
call, and thou be not ready.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the mark of effort.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Seek</span> not to have things happen as you
choose them, but rather choose them to
happen as they do, and so shall you live
prosperously.</p>

<p>2. Disease is a hindrance of the body,
not of the Will, unless the Will itself consent.
Lameness is a hindrance of the leg, not of
the Will. And this you may say on every
occasion, for nothing can happen to you but
you will find it a hindrance not of yourself
but of some other thing.</p>

<p>3. What, then, are the things that oppress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
us and perturb us? What else than opinions?
He that goeth away and leaveth his familiars
and companions and wonted places and
habits&mdash;with what else is he oppressed than
his opinions? Now, little children, if they
cry because their nurse has left them for a
while, straightway forget their sorrow when
they are given a small cake. Wilt thou be
likened unto a little child?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Nay, by Zeus! for I would not be
thus affected by a little cake, but by right
opinions.&#8221;</p>

<p>And what are these?</p>

<p>They are such as a man should study all
day long to observe&mdash;that he be not subject
to the effects of anything that is alien to
him, neither of friend, nor place, nor exercises;
yea, not even of his own body, but
to remember the Law, and have it ever before
his eyes. And what is the divine Law?
To hold fast that which is his own, and to
claim nothing that is another&#8217;s; to use what
is given him, and not to covet what is not
given; to yield up easily and willingly what
is taken away, giving thanks for the time
that he has had it at his service. This do&mdash;or
cry for the nurse and mamma; for
what doth it matter to what or whom thou
art subject, from what thy welfare hangs?
Wherein art thou better than one who bewails
himself for his mistress, if thou lament
thy exercises and porticoes and comrades,
and all such pastime? Another cometh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
grieving because he shall no more drink of
the water of Dirce. And is the Marcian
water worse than that of Dirce?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;But I was used to the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>And to this also thou shalt be used; and
when thou art so affected towards it, lament
for it too, and try to make a verse like that
of Euripides&mdash;</p>

<p>
&#8220;The baths of Nero and the Marcian stream&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1_65" id="FNanchor_1_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_65" class="fnanchor">1</a><br />
</p>

<p>Behold how tragedies are made, when common
chances happen to foolish men!</p>

<p>4.&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;But when shall I see Athens and
the Acropolis again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Wretched man! doth not that satisfy thee
which thou seest every day? Hast thou
aught better or greater to see than the sun,
the moon, the stars, the common earth, the
sea? But if withal thou mark the way of
Him that governeth the whole and bear
Him about within thee, wilt thou still long
for cut stones and a fine rock? And when
thou shalt come to leave the sun itself and
the moon, what wilt thou do? Sit down
and cry, like the children? What, then,
wert thou doing in the school? What didst
thou hear, what didst thou learn? Why
didst thou write thyself down a philosopher,
when thou mightest have written the truth,
as thus:&mdash;<i>I made certain beginnings, and
read Chrysippus, but did not so much as enter
the door of a philosopher</i>? For how shouldst
thou have aught in common with Socrates,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
who died as he died, who lived as he lived&mdash;or
with Diogenes? Dost thou think that
any of these men lamented or was indignant
because he should see such a man or
such a woman no more? or because he
should not dwell in Athens or in Corinth,
but, as it might chance, in Susa or Ecbatana?
When a man can leave the banquet or the
game when he pleases, shall such a one grieve
if he remains? Shall he not, as in a game,
stay only so long as he is entertained? A
man of this stamp would easily endure such a
thing as perpetual exile or sentence of death.</p>

<p>Wilt thou not now be weaned as children
are, and take more solid food, nor cry any
more after thy mother and nurse, wailing like
an old woman?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;But if I quit them I shall grieve
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thou grieve them? Never; but that shall
grieve them which grieveth thee&mdash;Opinion.
What hast thou then to do? Cast away thy
own bad opinion; and they, if they do well,
will cast away theirs; if not, they are the
causes of their own lamenting.</p>

<p>5. Man, be mad at last, as the saying is,
for peace, for freedom, for magnanimity.
Lift up thy head as one delivered from
slavery. Dare to look up to God and say:
<i>Deal with me henceforth as thou wilt; I am of
one mind with thee; I am thine. I reject
nothing that seems good to thee; lead me
whithersoever thou wilt, clothe me in what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
dress thou wilt. Wilt thou have me govern or
live privately, or stay at home, or go into exile,
or be a poor man or a rich? For all these
conditions I will be thy advocate with men&mdash;I
show the nature of each of them, what it is.</i></p>

<p>Nay, but sit in a corner and wait for thy
mother to feed thee.<a name="FNanchor_2_66" id="FNanchor_2_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_66" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>6. Who would Hercules have been if he
had sat at home? He would have been
Eurystheus, and not Hercules. And how
many companions and friends had he in his
journeying about the world? But nothing
was dearer to him than God; and for this he
was believed to be the son of God, yea, and
was the son of God. And trusting in God,
he went about purging away lawlessness
and wrong. But thou art no Hercules, and
canst not purge away evils not thine own?
nor yet Theseus, who cleared Attica of evil
things? Then clear away thine own. From
thy breast, from thy mind cast out, instead
of Procrustes and Sciron, grief, fear, covetousness,
envy, malice, avarice, effeminacy,
profligacy. And these things cannot otherwise
be cast out than by looking to God
only, being affected only by Him, and consecrated
to His commands. But choosing
anything else than this, thou wilt follow
with groaning and lamentation whatever
is stronger than thou, ever seeking prosperity
in things outside thyself, and never
able to attain it. For thou seekest it where
it is not, and neglectest to seek it where it is.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">faculties.</span></h4>

<p>Remember at anything that shall befall
thee to turn to thyself and seek what faculty
thou hast for making use of it. If thou see
a beautiful person, thou wilt find a faculty
for that&mdash;namely, Self-mastery. If toil is
laid upon thee, thou wilt find the faculty of
Perseverance. If thou art reviled, thou
wilt find Patience. And making this thy
wont, thou shalt not be carried away by the
appearances.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">returns.</span></h4>

<p>Never in any case say, <i>I have lost</i> such a
thing, but <i>I have returned it</i>. Is thy child
dead? it is returned. Is thy wife dead? she
is returned. Art thou deprived of thy estate?
is not this also returned?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;But he is wicked who deprives me
of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>But what is that to thee, through whom
the Giver demands his own? As long, therefore,
as he grants it to thee, steward it like
another&#8217;s property, as travelers use an inn.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the price of tranquillity.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">If</span> you would advance in philosophy
you must abandon such thoughts as, <i>If I
neglect my affairs I shall not have the means
of living. If I do not correct my servant he
will be good for nothing.</i> For it is better to
die of hunger, having lived without grief
and fear, than to live with a troubled spirit
amid abundance. And it is better to have a
bad servant than an afflicted mind.</p>

<p>2. Make a beginning then in small matters.
Is a little of your oil spilt, or a little
wine stolen? Then say to yourself, <i>For so
much peace is bought, this is the price of
tranquillity</i>. For nothing can be gained without
paying for it. And when you call
your servant, bethink you that he may not
hear, or, hearing, may not obey. For him,
indeed, that is not well, but for you it is
altogether well that he have not the power to
trouble your mind.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">a choice.</span></h4>

<p>If thou wouldst advance, be content to let
people think thee senseless and foolish as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
regards external things. Wish not ever to
seem wise, and if ever thou shalt find thyself
accounted to be somebody, then mistrust
thyself. For know that it is not easy
to make a choice that shall agree both with
outward things and with Nature, but it
must needs be that he who is careful of the
one shall neglect the other.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">that where the heart is the bond is.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Thou</span> art a fool if thou desire wife and
children and friends to live forever, for that
is desiring things to be in thy power which
are not in thy power, and things pertaining
to others to be thine own. So also thou art
a fool to desire that thy servant should
never do anything amiss, for that is desiring
evil not to be evil, but something else. But
if thou desire never to fail in any pursuit,
this thou canst do. This, therefore, practice
to attain&mdash;namely, the attainable.</p>

<p>2. The lord of each of us is he that hath
power over the things that we desire or dislike,
to give or to take them away. Whosoever,
then, will be free, let him neither
desire nor shun any of the things that are in
others&#8217; power; otherwise he must needs be
enslaved.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>3. Wherefore Demetrius<a name="FNanchor_2_66a" id="FNanchor_2_66a"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_66a" class="fnanchor">1</a> said to Nero,
<i>You threaten me with death, but Nature
threatens you</i>. If I am taken up with my
poor body, or my property, I have given
myself over to slavery, for I immediately
show of my own self with what I may be
captured. As when a snake draws in his
head, I say, <i>Strike at that part of him which
he guards</i>. And know thou, that at the part
thou desirest to guard, there thy master will
fall upon thee. Remembering this, whom
wilt thou still flatter or fear?</p>

<p>4. Think that thou shouldst conduct thyself
in life as at a feast. Is some dish
brought to thee? Then put forth thyself in
seemly fashion. Doth it pass thee by?
Then hold it not back. Hath it not yet
come? Then do not reach out for it at a
distance, but wait till it is at thine hand.
And thus doing with regard to children and
wife and governments and wealth, thou wilt
be a worthy guest at the table of the Gods.
And if thou even pass over things that are
offered to thee, and refuse to take of them,
then thou wilt not only share the banquet,
but also the dominion of the Gods. For so
doing Diogenes and Heracleitus, and the
like, both were, and were reported to be,
rightly divine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">that we lament not from within.</span></h4>

<p>When thou seest one lamenting in grief
because his son is gone abroad, or because
he hath lost his goods, look to it that thou
be not carried away by the appearance to
think that he hath truly fallen into misfortune,
in outward things. But be the thought
at hand, <i>It is not the thing itself that afflicts
this man&mdash;since there are others whom it
afflicts not&mdash;but the opinion he has about it</i>.
And so far as speech, be not slow to fit thyself
to his mood, and even if so it be to
lament with him. But have a care that thou
lament not also from within.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">that a man may act his part but not choose it.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Remember</span> that thou art an actor in a
play, of such a part as it may please the
director to assign thee; of a short part if he
choose a short part; of a long one if he
choose a long. And if he will have thee
take the part of a poor man, or of a cripple,
or a governor, or a private person, mayest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
thou act that part with grace! For thine it
is to act well the allotted part, but to choose
it is another&#8217;s.</p>

<p>2. Say no more then, <i>How will it be with
me?</i> for however it be thou wilt settle it
well, and the issue shall be fortunate.
What would Hercules have been had he
said, <i>How shall I contrive that a great lion
may not appear to me, or a great boar, or a
savage man?</i> And what hast thou to do
with that? if a great boar appear, thou wilt
fight the greater fight; if evil men, thou wilt
clear the earth of them. <i>But if I die thus?</i>
Thou wilt die a good man, in the accomplishing
of a noble deed. For since we
must by all means die, a man cannot be
found but he will be doing somewhat, either
tilling or digging or trading or governing, or
having an indigestion or a diarrh&oelig;a. What
wilt thou, then, that Death shall find thee
doing? I, for my part, will choose some
work, humane, beneficent, social, noble.
But if I am not able to be found doing things
of this greatness, then, at least, I will be
doing that which none can hinder me to do,
that which is given to me to do&mdash;namely,
correcting myself, bettering my faculty for
making use of appearances, working out my
peace, giving what is due in every obligation
of life; and if I prosper so far, then
entering upon the third topic of philosophy,
which concerneth the security of judgments.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>3. If Death shall find me in the midst of
these studies, it shall suffice me if I can lift
up my hands to God and say, <i>The means
which thou gavest me for the perceiving of thy
government, and for the following of the same,
have I not neglected: so far as in me lies, I
have not dishonored thee. Behold how I
have used my senses, and my natural conceptions.
Have I ever blamed thee? was I ever
offended at aught that happened, or did I desire
it should happen otherwise? Did I ever desire
to transgress my obligations? That thou
didst beget me I thank thee for what thou
gavest. I am content that I have used thy
gifts so long. Take them again, and set them
in what place thou wilt, for thine were all
things, and thou gavest them me.</i></p>

<p>4. Is it not enough to depart in this condition?
and what life is better and fairer
than one like this, and what end more
happy?</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">distinctions.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">When</span> a raven croaks you a bad omen,
be not carried away by the appearance; but
straightway distinguish with yourself and
say, <i>None of these things bodes aught to myself,
but either to this poor body or this wretched
property of mine, or to my good repute, or to
my children, or to my wife. But to me all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
omens are fortunate if I choose to have it so.
For whatever of these things may come to
pass, it lies with me to have it serve me.</i></p>

<p>2. You may be always victorious if you
will never enter into any contest but where
the victory depends upon yourself.</p>

<p>3. When you shall see a man honored
above others, or mighty in power, or otherwise
esteemed, look to it that thou deem him
not blessed, being carried away by the appearance.
For if the essence of the Good
be in those things that are in our own
power, then neither envy nor jealousy have
any place, nor thou thyself shalt not desire
to be commander or prince or consul, but to
be free. And to this there is one road&mdash;scorn
of the things that are not in our own
power.</p>

<p>4. Remember, it is not he that strikes or
he that reviles that doth any man an injury,
but the opinion about these things, that they
are injurious. When, then, some one may
provoke thee to wrath, know that it is thine
own conception which hath provoked thee.
Strive, therefore, at the outset not to be
carried away by the appearance; for if thou
once gain time and delay, thou wilt more
easily master thyself.</p>

<p>5. Death and exile, and all things that
appear dreadful, let these be every day
before thine eyes. But Death most of all;
for so thou wilt neither despise nor too
greatly desire any condition of life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">that a man is sufficient to himself.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">If</span> thou set thine heart upon philosophy,
prepare straightway to be laughed at and
mocked by many who will say, <i>Behold, he
has suddenly come back to us a philosopher</i>;
or, <i>How came you by that brow of scorn?</i>
But do thou cherish no scorn, but hold to
those things that seem to thee the best, as
one set by God in that place. Remember,
too, that if thou abide in that way, those
that first mocked thee, the same shall afterwards
reverence thee; but if thou yield to
them, thou shalt receive double mockery.</p>

<p>2. If it shall ever happen to thee to be
turned to outward things in the desire to
please some person, know that thou hast
lost thy way of life. Let it be enough for
thee in all things to <i>be</i> a philosopher. But
if thou desire also to seem one, then seem
so to thyself, for this thou canst.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">that every man fulfill his own task.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Let</span> such thoughts never afflict thee as,
<i>I shall live unhonored, and never be anybody
anywhere</i>. For if lack of honor be an evil,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
thou canst no more fall into evil through
another&#8217;s doings than into vice. Is it, then,
of thy own doing to be made a governor, or
invited to feasts? By no means. How,
then, is this to be unhonored? How
shouldst thou <i>never be anybody anywhere</i>,
whom it behooves to be somebody only in the
things that are in thine own power, wherein
it lies with thee to be of the greatest worth?</p>

<p>2. <i>But I shall not be able to serve my
friends.</i> How sayst thou? to serve them?
They shall not have money from thee, nor
shalt thou make them Roman citizens.
Who, then, told thee that these were of the
things that are in our power, and not alien
to us? And who can give that which himself
hath not?</p>

<p>3. <i>Acquire, then</i>, they say, <i>that we may
possess</i>. If I can acquire, and lose not
piety, and faith, and magnanimity withal,
show me the way, and I will do it. But if
ye will have me lose the good things I possess,
that ye may compass things that are
not good at all, how unjust and unthinking
are ye? But which will ye rather have&mdash;money,
or a faithful and pious friend?
Then, rather take part with me to this end;
and ask me not to do aught through which I
must cast away those things.</p>

<p>4. <i>But</i>, he saith, <i>I shall not do my part in
serving my country</i>. Again, what is this
service? Thy country shall not have porticos
nor baths from thee, and what then?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Neither hath she shoes from the smith, nor
arms from the cobbler; but it is enough if
every man fulfill his own task. And if thou
hast made one other pious and faithful citizen
for her, art thou, then, of no service?
Wherefore, neither shalt thou be useless to
thy country.</p>

<p>5. <i>What place, then</i>, he saith, <i>can I hold in
the State</i>? Whatever place thou canst,
guarding still thy faith and piety. But if in
wishing to serve her thou cast away these
things, what wilt thou profit her then, when
perfected in shamelessness and faithlessness?</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the world&#8217;s price for the world&#8217;s worth.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Is</span> some one preferred before thee at a
feast, or in salutation, or in being invited to
give counsel? Then, if these things are
good, it behooves thee rejoice that he hath
gained them; but if evil, be not vexed
that thou hast not gained them; but remember
that if thou act not as other men to
gain the things that are not in our own
power, neither canst thou be held worthy of
a like reward with them.</p>

<p>2. For how is it possible for him who will
not hang about other men&#8217;s doors to have a
like reward with him who doth so? or him
who will not attend on them with him who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
doth attend? or him who will not flatter them
with the flatterer? Thou art unjust, then,
and insatiable, if thou desire to gain those
things for nothing, without paying the price
for which they are sold.</p>

<p>3. But how much is a lettuce sold for?
A penny, perchance. If any one, then, will
spend a penny, he shall have lettuce; but
thou, not spending, shalt not have. But
think not thou art worse off than he; for as
he has the lettuce, so thou the penny which
thou wouldst not give.</p>

<p>4. And likewise in this matter. Thou art
not invited to some man&#8217;s feast? That is, for
thou gavest not to the host the price of the
supper; and it is sold for flattery, it is sold
for attendance. Pay, then, the price, if it
will profit thee, for which the thing is sold.
But if thou wilt not give the price, and wilt
have the thing, greedy art thou and infatuated.</p>

<p>5. Shalt thou have nothing, then, instead
of the supper? Thou shalt have this&mdash;not
to have praised one whom thou hadst no
mind to praise, and not to have endured the
insolence of his door-keepers.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">aims of nature.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> will of Nature is to be learned
from matters which do not concern our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>selves.<a name="FNanchor_1_67" id="FNanchor_1_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_67" class="fnanchor">1</a>
Thus, when a boy may break the
cup of another man, we are ready to say,
<i>It is a common chance</i>. Know, then, that
when thine own is broken, it behooves thee
to be as though it were another man&#8217;s.
And apply this even to greater things.
Has another man&#8217;s child died, or his wife?
who is there that will not say, <i>It is the lot of
humanity</i>. But when his own may die, then
straightway it is, <i>Alas, wretched that I am!</i>
But we should bethink ourselves what we
felt on hearing of others in the same plight.</p>

<p>2. As a mark is not set up to be missed,
even so the nature of evil exists not in the
universe.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the mind&#8217;s security.</span></h4>

<p>If any one should set your body at the
mercy of every passer-by, you would be
indignant. When, therefore, you set your
own mind at the mercy of every chance, to
be troubled and perturbed when any one may
revile you, have you no shame of this?</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">that a man should be one man.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">In</span> every work you will take in hand
mark well what must go before and what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
must follow, and so proceed. For else you
shall at first set out eagerly, as not regarding
what is to follow; but in the end, if any
difficulties have arisen, you will leave it off
with shame.</p>

<p>2. So you wish to conquer in the Olympic
games? And I, too, by the Gods; and a
fine thing it would be. But mark the prefaces
and the consequences, and then set to
work. You must go under discipline, eat
by rule, abstain from dainties, exercise yourself
at the appointed hour, in heat or cold,
whether you will or no, drink nothing cold,
nor wine at will; in a word, you must give
yourself over to the trainer as to a physician.
Then in the contest itself there is the digging
race,<a name="FNanchor_1_68" id="FNanchor_1_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_68" class="fnanchor">1</a> and you are like enough to dislocate
your wrist, or turn your ankle, to swallow a
great deal of dust, to be soundly drubbed,
and after all these things to be defeated.</p>

<p>3. If, having considered these things, you
are still in the mind to enter for the contest,
then do so. But without consideration you
will turn from one thing to another like a
child, who now plays the wrestler, now the
gladiator, now sounds the trumpet, then
declaims like an actor; and so you, too,
will be first an athlete, then a gladiator,
then an orator, then a philosopher, and
nothing with your whole soul; but as an
ape you will mimic everything you see, and
be charmed with one thing after another.
For you approached nothing with consider<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>ation
nor regularity, but rashly, and with a
cold desire.</p>

<p>4. And thus some men, having seen a
philosopher, and heard discourse like that
of Euphrates<a name="FNanchor_2_69" id="FNanchor_2_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_69" class="fnanchor">2</a> (yet who indeed can say that
any discourse is like his?), desire that they
also may become philosophers.</p>

<p>5. But, O man! consider first what it is
you are about to do, and then inquire of
your own nature whether you can carry it
out. Will you be a pentathlos,<a name="FNanchor_3_70" id="FNanchor_3_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_70" class="fnanchor">3</a> or a wrestler?
Then, scan your arms and thighs;
try your loins. For different men are made
for different ends.</p>

<p>6. Think you, you can be a sage, and
continue to eat and drink and be wrathful
and take offense just as you were wont?
Nay, but you must watch and labor, and
withdraw yourself from your household,
and be despised by any serving boy, and be
ridiculed by your neighbors, and take the
lower place everywhere, in honors, in authority,
in courts of justice, in dealings
of every kind.<a name="FNanchor_4_71" id="FNanchor_4_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_71" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>7. Consider these things&mdash;whether you
are willing at such a price to gain peace,
freedom, and an untroubled spirit. And if
not, then attempt it not, nor, like a child,
play now the philosopher, then the tax-gatherer,
then the orator, then the Procurator
of C&aelig;sar. For these things agree not
among themselves; and, good or bad, it
behooves you to be one man. You should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
be perfecting either your own ruling faculty,
or your outward well-being; spending
your art either on the life within or the life
without; that is to say, you must hold your
place either among the sages or the vulgar.</p>

<h3><i>BOOK III.</i></h3>

<h3><br />CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">obligations.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Obligations</span> are universally defined by
the bonds of relation. Is such a man your
father? Then it is implied that you are to
take care of him, to give place to him in all
things, to bear his rebukes, his chastisement.
<i>But if he be a bad father?</i> Were you then
related by any law of Nature to a good
father? Nay, but simply to a father. Your
brother does you wrong. Then guard your
own place towards him, nor scrutinize what
he is doing, but what you may do to keep
your will in accord with Nature. For none
other shall hurt you, if yourself choose it
not, but you shall be hurt then when you
conceive yourself to be so.</p>

<p>2. Thus shall you discover your obligations
from the offices of a neighbor, a citizen,
a general, if you will accustom yourself to
watch the relationships.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">against epicurus.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Even</span> Epicurus is conscious that we are
by nature social, but having once placed
the Good in the husk,<a name="FNanchor_1_72" id="FNanchor_1_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_72" class="fnanchor">1</a> he cannot thereafter
speak anything but what agrees with this;
for again he affirms, and rightly affirms,
that nothing is to be admired or received
that is separated from the nature of the
Good. How, then, Epicurus, do you suspect
that we are social, if Nature had
given us no affection for our offspring?<a name="FNanchor_2_73" id="FNanchor_2_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_73" class="fnanchor">2</a>
Wherefore do you counsel the sage against
bringing up children? Why do you fear
lest he fall into sorrow by so doing? Doth
he fall into sorrow for the mouse that lives
in his house? What careth he if a little
mouse complain to him at home. But he
knows well that if a little child be born, it
is no longer in our power not to love it and
be anxious for it.</p>

<p>2. Thus, too, he saith that no man of
sense will take part in affairs of the state,
for he knows what he who takes part in
them must do; but what should hinder one
to take part, if he may behave among men
as in a swarm of flies? But Epicurus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
knowing these things, dares to say that we
should not rear up our children. But even
a sheep will not desert its young, nor a wolf;
and shall a man? <i>What! will you have us to
be silly creatures, like the sheep?</i> Yet they
desert not their young. <i>Or savage, like
wolves?</i> Yet even they desert them not.
Come, then, who would obey you if he saw
his little child fall on the ground and cry?
For my part, I suppose that had it been prophesied
to your mother and your father that
you would say these things, not even so
would they have cast you out.</p>

<p>3. <i>But how can it be said of these outward
things</i><a name="FNanchor_3_74" id="FNanchor_3_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_74" class="fnanchor">3</a> <i>that they are according to Nature, or
contrary to Nature?</i> That is to speak as if
we were solitary and disunited from others.
For to the foot I shall say it is according to
Nature that it be clean; but if you take it as
a foot, and not as a solitary thing, it shall beseem
it to go into the mud, and to tread on
thorns, and perchance to be cut off, for the
sake of the whole; otherwise it is no longer
a foot.</p>

<p>4. And some such thing we should suppose
about ourselves also. What art thou?
A man. Look at thyself as a solitary creature,
and it is according to Nature to live to
old age, to grow rich, to keep good health.
But if thou look at thyself as a man, and as
a part of a certain Whole, for the sake of
that Whole it may become thee now to
have sickness, now to sail the seas and run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
into peril, now to suffer need, and perchance
to die before thy time.</p>

<p>5. Why, then, dost thou bear it hard?
Knowest thou not, that as the foot alone is
not a foot, so thou alone art not a man?
For what is a man? A part of a polity,
first of that which is made up of Gods and
men; then of that which is said to be next
to the other, which is a small copy of the
Universal Polity.</p>

<p>6. <i>Then must I now be brought to trial, and
now must another have a fever, and another
sail the seas, another die, another be sentenced?</i>
Yea, for with such a body, in the bounds of
such a universe, in such a throng of inhabitants,
it cannot be but that different things
of this nature should fall on different persons.
This is thy task, then, having come into the
world, to speak what thou shouldst, and to
order these things as it is fitting.</p>

<p>7. Then some one saith, <i>I charge you with
wrong-doing</i>. Much good may it do thee!
I have done my part&mdash;look to it thyself if
thou have done thine, for of this too there
is some danger, lest it escape thee.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">against the epicureans and academics.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Beliefs</span> which are sound and manifestly
true are of necessity used even by
those who deny them. And perhaps a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
might adduce this as the greatest possible
proof of the manifest truth of anything, that
those who deny it are compelled to make
use of it. Thus, if a man should deny that
there is anything universally true, it is clear
that he is obliged to affirm the contrary, the
negation&mdash;that there is nothing universally
true. Slave! not even this&mdash;for what is
this but to say that if there is anything universal
it is falsehood?</p>

<p>2. Again, if one should come and say,
<i>Know that nothing can be known, but all
things are incapable of proof; or another,
Believe me, and it shall profit thee, that no man
ought to believe any man</i>; or again, another,
<i>Learn from me, O man, that it is not possible
to learn anything, and I tell thee this, and I
will teach thee, if thou wilt</i>&mdash;now wherein do
such men differ from those&mdash;whom shall I
say?&mdash;those who call themselves Academics?
<i>Assent, O men, that no man can assent
to aught; believe us that no man can believe
any one.</i></p>

<p>3. Thus Epicurus, when he would abolish
the natural fellowship of men with one another,
employeth the very thing that is being
abolished. For what saith he? <i>Be not deceived,
O men, nor misguided nor mistaken&mdash;there
is no natural fellowship among reasoning
beings, believe me; and those who speak
otherwise deceive us with sophisms.</i> What is
that to thee? let us be deceived! Will it be
the worse for thee if all other men are per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>suaded
that we have a natural fellowship
with one another, and that we should in
all ways maintain it? Nay&mdash;but much the
better and safer. Man, why dost thou take
thought for us, and watch at night for our
sakes? Why dost thou kindle thy lamp and
rise early? why dost thou write so many
books, lest any of us should be deceived
about the Gods, in supposing that they cared
for men? or lest any one should take the
essence of the Good to be anything else
than Pleasure? For if these things are so,
then lie down and sleep, and live the life of
a worm, wherefor thou hast judged thyself
fit; eat and drink and cohabit and ease thyself
and snore. What is it to thee how other
men think concerning these matters, whether
soundly or unsoundly? What hast thou to
do with us? With sheep hast thou some
concern, for that they serve us when they
are shorn, and when they are milked, and
at last when they have their throats cut.
Were it not, then, to be desired, if men could
be lulled and charmed to slumber by the
Stoics, and give themselves to thee and the
like of thee, to be shorn and milked? These
things shouldst thou say to thy brother
Epicureans; but shouldst thou not keep them
hidden from other men, and seek in every
way to persuade them above all things that
we are by nature social, and that temperance
is good; in order that everything may
be kept for thee? Or should we preserve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
this fellowship with some and not with
others? With whom, then, should we preserve
it? With those who also preserve it
towards us, or with those who transgress it?
And who transgress it more than ye, who
set forth such doctrines?</p>

<p>4. What, then, was it that roused up
Epicurus from his sleep, and compelled him
to write the things he wrote? What else
than Nature, the mightiest of all powers in
humanity? Nature, that drags the man,
reluctant and groaning, to her will. <i>For</i>,
saith she, <i>since it seems to thee that there is no
fellowship among men, write this down, and
deliver it to others, and watch and wake for
this, and be thyself by thine own deed the
accuser of thine own opinions</i>. Shall we, then,
say that Orestes was driven by the Furies
and aroused from sleep, and did not crueller
Furies and Avengers rouse this man as he
slumbered, and suffered him not to rest, but
compelled him, as madness and wine the
priests of Cybele,<a name="FNanchor_1_75" id="FNanchor_1_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_75" class="fnanchor">1</a> to proclaim his own evils?
So mighty and invincible a thing is man&#8217;s
nature.</p>

<p>5. For how can a vine be affected, and
not in the manner of a vine, but of an olive?
Or how, again, can an olive be affected not
in the manner of an olive but of a vine? It
is impossible, it cannot be conceived.
Neither, then, is it possible for a man wholly
to lose the affections of humanity, for even
eunuchs cannot cut away for themselves the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
desires of men. And thus Epicurus has cut
away all that belongs to a man as father of
a family, and as citizen, and as friend; but
the desires of humanity he hath not cut
away, for he could not; no more than these
pitiful Academics are able to cast away or
to blind their own perceptions, although
this is the thing that they have striven with
all their zeal to do.</p>

<p>6. How shameful is this! that a man
having received from Nature measures and
canons for the recognition of truth, should
study not to add to them and perfect them
where they are wanting, but the very contrary
of this; if there be anything that may
lead us to the knowledge of the truth, they
strive to abolish and destroy it.</p>

<p>7. What sayest thou, philosopher? religion
and holiness, what dost thou take them
for?<a name="FNanchor_2_76" id="FNanchor_2_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_76" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;If thou wilt, I shall prove that they
are good.&#8221;</p>

<p>So be it; prove it then, in order that our
citizens may be converted and honor the
Divinity, and be no longer neglectful of the
greatest things.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Now hast thou received the proofs?&#8221;</p>

<p>I have, and am thankful therefor.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Now since thou art exceedingly
well pleased with these things, hear the contrary:
There are no Gods, or if there be,
they have no care for men, nor have we any
communion with them; and this religion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
and holiness, whereof the multitude babble,
is the lying of impostors and sophists, or of
legislators, by Zeus! for the frighting and
restraining of evil-doers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well said, philosopher! the citizens shall
have much profit of thee! thou hast already
brought back all our youths to the contempt
of sacred things.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;What now? are these doctrines not
pleasing to thee? Learn, then, that Righteousness
is nothing, that Reverence is folly,
that a father is nothing, a son nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well said, philosopher! proceed, persuade
the young, that we may multiply the number
of those who believe and speak with
thee. From these teachings have grown
our well-governed States, from these did
Sparta spring, and these beliefs, by his laws
and discipline, did Lycurgus plant among
his people:&mdash;That slavery is no more base
than honorable, nor to be free men more
honorable than base. Through these opinions
died those who fell at Thermopyl&aelig;, and
through what others did the Athenians forsake
their city?<a name="FNanchor_3_77" id="FNanchor_3_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_77" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>9. Then those who speak such things
marry, and beget children, and take part in
public affairs, and make themselves priests
and augurs&mdash;of what? Of beings that do
not exist! and they question the Pythian
oracle that they may learn falsehoods; and
they declare the oracles to others. O monstrous
impudence and imposture!</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">on slavery.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">A</span> certain man having inquired how
one may make his meals in a manner pleasing
to the Gods, If he do it uprightly, said
Epictetus, and considerately, and equably,
and temperately, and orderly, shall it not
also be thus pleasing to the Gods? But
when you ask for hot water, and the boy
does not hear, or, hearing, brings it only
luke-warm; or if he is not even to be found
in the house, then is it not pleasing to the
Gods if you refrain from indignation, and
do not burst with passion? <i>How shall one
endure such fellows?</i> Wretch, wilt thou
not bear with thine own brother, who is of
the progeny of Zeus, like a son sprung of
the same seed as thyself, and of the same
heavenly descent, but thou must straightway
make thyself a tyrant, for the place of command
in which thou art set? Wilt thou not
remember who thou art, and whom thou
rulest&mdash;that they are kinsmen, brethren by
nature, the progeny of Zeus? <i>But I have
bought them, and they have not bought me!</i>
Seest thou, then, whither thou art looking&mdash;towards
the earth, towards the pit of perdition,
towards these miserable laws of dead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
men? but towards the laws of the Gods
thou dost not look.</p>

<p>2. That which thou wouldst not suffer
thyself, seek not to lay upon others. Thou
wouldst not be a slave&mdash;look to it that
others be not slaves to thee. For if thou
endure to have slaves, it seems that thou
thyself art first of all a slave. For virtue
hath no communion with vice nor freedom
with slavery.</p>

<p>3. As one who is in health would not
choose to be served by the sick, nor that
those dwelling with him should be sick, so
neither would one that is free bear to be
served by slaves, or that those living with
him should be slaves.<a name="FNanchor_1_78" id="FNanchor_1_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_78" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">to the administrator of the free cities,
who was an epicurean.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> Administrator<a name="FNanchor_1_79" id="FNanchor_1_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_79" class="fnanchor">1</a> having visited him
(and this man was an Epicurean), It is
proper, said Epictetus, that ignorant people
like us should inquire of you that are philosophers
(as men who come into a strange
city make inquiry of the citizens and those
familiar with the place) what is the chief
thing in the world, to the end that, having
learned it, we may go in search of it, and behold
it, as men do with objects in the cities.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>2. Now, that there are three things with
which man is concerned&mdash;soul, and body,
and the outer world&mdash;scarce any one will
deny. It remaineth, then, for men like ye
to answer which is the chief of these things?
What shall we declare to men? Is it the
flesh? And was it for this that Maximus
sent forth his son, and sailed with him
through the tempest as far as Cassiope,<a name="FNanchor_2_80" id="FNanchor_2_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_80" class="fnanchor">2</a> for
somewhat that he should feel in the flesh?</p>

<p>3. But the Epicurean denying this, and
saying, <i>God forbid</i>, Epictetus said:</p>

<p>Is it not fit, then, that we should be zealous
about that, the chief thing?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Of all things most fit.&#8221;</p>

<p>What, then, have we greater than the
flesh?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;The soul,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>And the good of the chief thing, is it
greater than the good of the lower thing?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;The good of the chief thing is
greater.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the good things of the soul, are they
in the power of the Will, or beyond the
Will?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;They are in the power of the Will.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pleasure of the soul, then, is within
the power of the Will?</p>

<p>He assented.</p>

<p>And this pleasure itself, whence may it
arise? From itself? But this is inconceivable;
for we must suppose some original
substance of the Good, whereof the soul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
doth make us sensible when we light upon
it.</p>

<p>This, too, he admitted.</p>

<p>Wherein, then, are we sensible of this
spiritual pleasure? for if it be in spiritual
things, the nature of the Good is discovered.
For the Good cannot be something different
from the thing that justly delights us; nor,
if the original thing be not good, can aught
be good that proceeds from it; for, in order
that the thing proceeding may be good, the
original thing must be good also. But this
ye would never say, if ye had your wits,
for so ye would speak things that agree not
with Epicurus and the rest of your opinions.
It remains, then, that we are conscious in
bodily things of this pleasure of the soul,
and again, that these are the original things
and the very substance of the Good.<a name="FNanchor_3_81" id="FNanchor_3_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_81" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>4. Wherefore Maximus did foolishly if he
made his voyage for the sake of anything
else than the flesh; that is, than the chief
thing. And any man doth foolishly who
restraineth himself from others&#8217; good, if he
be a judge, and able to take them. But, if
you please, let us regard this only, how it
may be done secretly and safely, and so
that none may know it. For neither does
Epicurus himself declare stealing to be bad,
but only to be caught stealing; and because
it is impossible to be certain of no discovery,
therefore he saith, <i>Ye shall not steal</i>. But I
say that if we steal with skill and discretion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
we shall not be caught. And, moreover, if
we have powerful friends among men and
women at Rome, and the Greeks are feeble,
no one will dare to go thither on this
score. Why do you refrain from your own
good? This is foolish&mdash;this is absurd. But
not even if you tell me you do refrain will I
believe you. For, as it is impossible to assent
to anything that appeareth to be a falsehood
or to turn away from what appeareth to
be true, even so it is impossible to withhold
oneself from anything that appeareth to be
good. But riches are a good, and, at all
events, the most potent means of pleasure.
Wherefore, then, not compass them? And
why not corrupt our neighbor&#8217;s wife, if we
may do it secretly? and also, if the husband
talk nonsense about it, let us fling him out!
If you will be a true and perfect philosopher,
and obedient to your own doctrines, thus
must you do; but if you do not, you differ
no whit from us that are called Stoics. For
truly we ourselves say one thing and do
another; we speak fair and honest things,
and do vile ones. But the opposite distemper
will be thine&mdash;a vile creed and honorable
deeds.</p>

<p>5. And you think, God help you! of a
city of Epicureans? <i>I do not marry. Nor
I; for it is not right to marry, nor beget
children, nor take part in public affairs.</i>
What will come to pass then? Whence
shall we have citizens? who shall educate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
them? who shall be the overseer of youth?<a name="FNanchor_4_82" id="FNanchor_4_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_82" class="fnanchor">4</a>
who the director of gymnastics? and how
shall the youth be trained up? as the Laced&aelig;monians?
or as the Athenians? Take
me a youth, and bring him up after these
doctrines of thine! Evil are they, subversive
of States, mischievous to households,
unbecoming to women. Abandon them,
man! Thou dwellest in a chief city; it is
thy part to rule, to judge righteously, to
refrain from other men&#8217;s goods; nor must
any woman seem beautiful to thee save
thine own wife, nor vessel of gold or silver.
Seek for doctrines in harmony with these
words, from which setting out thou mayest
with gladness abandon things so potent to
attract and overcome. But if beside the
seduction of these things we have sought
out some philosophy like this that pushes
us towards them, and confirms us in them,
what shall come of it?</p>

<p>6. In the graver&#8217;s work, which is the chief
thing? the silver or the art? The substance
of the hand is flesh, but the main things are
the works of the hand. The obligations,
therefore, are also three&mdash;those that concern
us, firstly, in that we are; and secondly, as
we are; and thirdly, the main things themselves.
And thus in man, too, it is not
meet to value the material, this flesh, but the
main things. What are these? To take
part in public affairs, to marry, to beget
children, to fear God, to care for parents,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
and, in general, to pursue, to avoid, to desire,
to dislike, as each of these things should be
done, as Nature made us to do. And how
made she us? To be free, generous, pious.
For what other creature blushes? what
other is capable of the sense of shame?</p>

<p>7. And to these things let Pleasure be
subject as a minister, a servant, that she
may summon forth our ardor, and that she
also may aid in works that are according to
Nature.<a name="FNanchor_5_83" id="FNanchor_5_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_83" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>8. &mdash;&mdash;&#8220;But I am a wealthy man, and
have no need of aught.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why, then, dost thou profess philosophy?
Thy vessels of gold and vessels of silver are
enough for thee; what need hast thou of
doctrines?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;But I am also a judge of the
Greeks!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dost thou know how to judge&mdash;who made
thee know?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;C&aelig;sar wrote me a commission.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let him write thee a commission to be a
judge of music, and what help will it be to
thee? And how didst thou become a judge?
by kissing of what man&#8217;s hand? Was it
that of Symphorus or Numenius? Before
whose bed-chamber didst thou sleep? To
whom didst thou send gifts? Dost thou not
perceive, then, that to be a judge is worth
just as much as Numenius is worth?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;But I can cast into prison whom I
will.&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<p>As if he were a stone.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;But I can flog any man I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>As if he were an ass. This is no government
of men. Rule us as reasoning beings;
show us what is for our good, and we shall
follow it; show us what is for our ill, and we
shall turn away from it; make us emulators
of thyself, as Socrates made his disciples.
He, indeed, was one that governed men as
men, who made them subject unto him in
their pursuit and their avoidance, their
desire and dislike. <i>Do this, do not this, or
I will cast thee into prison.</i> This is not the
rule of reasoning beings. But, <i>As Zeus hath
ordered, so do thou act; but if thou dost not,
thou shall suffer loss and hurt</i>. What hurt?
<i>None other than this&mdash;not to have done what
it behooved thee to do. Thou shall lose faith,
piety, decency&mdash;look for no greater injuries
than these.</i></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">on statecraft.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Not</span> with the stones of Eub&oelig;a and
Sparta let the structure of your city walls
be variegated; but let the discipline and
teaching that comes from Greece penetrate
with order the minds of citizens and
statesmen. For with the thoughts of men
are cities well established, and not with
wood and stone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>2. If thou wouldst have a household well
established, then follow the example of the
Spartan Lycurgus. For even as he did not
fence the city with walls, but fortified the
inhabitants with virtue, and so preserved the
city free for ever, thus do thou not surround
thyself with a great court and set up lofty
towers, but confirm the dwellers in the house
with good-will, and faith, and friendliness,
and no harmful thing shall enter; no, not if the
whole army of evil were arrayed against it.</p>

<p>3. Which of us will not admire Lycurgus,
the Laced&aelig;monian? For having lost an
eye at the hands of one of the citizens, and
having received the young man from the people
that he should punish him as he would,
he refrained from this; but having taught
him and proved him to be a good man, he
brought him into the theater. And when
the Laced&aelig;monians marveled, <i>I received this
man from you</i>, he said, <i>insolent and violent;
I give him back to you mild and civil</i>.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">on friendship.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Whereinsoever</span> a man is zealous, this,
it is fair to suppose, he loveth. Are men,
then, zealous for evil things? Never.<a name="FNanchor_1_84" id="FNanchor_1_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_84" class="fnanchor">1</a> Or,
perchance, for things which do not concern
them? Nor for them either. It remaineth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
then, that they are zealous about good
things only; and that if they are zealous
about them, they also love them. Whosoever,
then, hath understanding of good
things, the same would know how to love.
But he who is not able to distinguish good
things from evil, and things that are neither
from both, how could this man yet be capable
of loving? To love, then, is a quality
of the wise alone.</p>

<p>2. <i>And how is this</i>, saith one, <i>for I am
foolish, and none the less do I love my child</i>.
By the Gods! I wonder, then, how you
have begun by confessing yourself to be
foolish. For wherein do you lack? Do you
not use your senses? do you not judge of
appearances? do you not bring to the body
the nourishment it needeth, and the covering
and habitation? Wherefore, then, confess
yourself to be a fool? Because, forsooth,
you are often perplexed by appearances, and
troubled, and you are vanquished by their
plausibility; and you take the same things
to be now good, and now evil, and then
indifferent; and, in a word, you grieve
and fear and envy, and are troubled, and
changed&mdash;for these things you confess yourself
a fool.</p>

<p>3. But do you never change in love?
But is it wealth, and pleasure, and, in short,
things, alone that you sometimes take to be
good and sometimes evil? and do you not
take the same men to be now good, now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
evil? and sometimes you are friendly disposed
towards them, and sometimes hostile?
and sometimes you praise them, and sometimes
you blame?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Yea, even so I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>What then? a man who hath been deceived
about another, is he, think you, his
friend?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Assuredly not.&#8221;</p>

<p>And one who hath taken a friend out of a
humor for change, hath he good-will towards
him?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Nor he either.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he who now reviles another, and
afterwards reveres him?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Nor he.&#8221;</p>

<p>What then? Sawest thou never the
whelps of a dog, how they fawn and sport
with each other, that you would say nothing
can be more loving? But to know what
friendship is, fling a piece of flesh among
them, and thou shalt learn. And cast between
thee and thy child a scrap of land, and
thou shalt learn how the child will quickly
wish to bury thee, and thou wilt pray that
he may die. And then thou wilt say, <i>What a
child have I nourished! this long time he is
burying me!</i> Throw a handsome girl between
you, and the old man will love her,
and the young too;<a name="FNanchor_2_85" id="FNanchor_2_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_85" class="fnanchor">2</a> and if it be glory, or
some risk to run, it will be on the same
fashion. You will speak the words of the
father of Admetus<a name="FNanchor_3_86" id="FNanchor_3_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_86" class="fnanchor">3</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;Day gladdens thee; think&#8217;st thou it glads not me?</span>
<span class="i0">Thou lovest light; think&#8217;st thou I love the dark?&#8221;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Think you this man did not love his own
child when it was little? nor was in agony
if it had a fever? nor said many a time,
<i>Would that I had the fever rather than he!</i>
Then when the trial cometh and is near at
hand, lo, what words they utter! And
Eteocles and Polyneices,<a name="FNanchor_4_87" id="FNanchor_4_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_87" class="fnanchor">4</a> were they not
children of the same mother and the same
father? were they not brought up together,
did they not live together, drink together,
sleep together, and often kiss one another?
So that any one who saw them, I think,
would have laughed at the philosophers, for
the things they say perversely about friendship.
But when royalty, like a piece of flesh,
hath fallen between them, hear what things
they speak:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;<i>Pol.</i> Where wilt thou stand before the towers?</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Et.</i> Wherefore seekest thou to know?</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Pol.</i> There I too would stand and slay thee.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Et.</i> Thou hast spoken my desire.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>4. For universally, be not deceived,
nothing is so dear to any creature as its own
profit. Whatsoever may seem to hinder this,
be it father or child or friend or lover, this
he will hate and abuse and curse. For
Nature hath never so made anything as to
love aught but its own profit: this is father
and brother and kin and country and God.
When, then, the Gods appear to hinder us in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
this, we revile even them, and overthrow
their images and burn their temples; as
Alexander, when his friend died, commanded
to burn the temples of Esculapius.</p>

<p>5. Therefore, if a man place in the same
thing both profit and holiness, and the beautiful
and fatherland, and parents and friends,
all these things shall be saved; but if he
place profit in one thing, and friends and
fatherland and kinsfolk, yea, and righteousness
itself some other where, all these things
shall perish, for profit shall outweigh them.
For where the I and the Mine are, thither, of
necessity, inclineth every living thing: if in
the flesh, then the supremacy is there; if in
the Will, it is there; if in outward things, it is
there. If, then, mine I is where my Will is,
thus only shall I be the friend I should be,
or the son or the father. For my profit then
will be to cherish faith and piety and forbearance
and continence and helpfulness; and to
guard the bonds of relation. But if I set
Myself in one place and Virtue some otherwhere,
then the word of Epicurus waxeth
strong, which declareth that there is no
Virtue, or, at least, that Virtue is but conceit.</p>

<p>6. Through this ignorance did Athenians
and Laced&aelig;monians quarrel with each other,
and Thebans with both of them, and the
Great King with Hellas, and Macedonians
with both of them, and even now Romans
with Get&aelig;; and through this yet earlier
the wars of Ilion arose. Paris was the guest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
of Menelaus; and if any one had seen
how friendly-minded towards each other
they were, he would have disbelieved
any one who said they were not friends.
But a morsel was flung between them&mdash;a
fair woman, and about her there was war.
And now when you see friends or brothers
that seem to be of one mind, argue nothing
from this concerning their friendship; nay,
not if they swear it, not if they declare that
they cannot be parted from each other.
For in the ruling faculty of a worthless man
there is no faith; it is unstable, unaccountable,
victim of one appearance after another.
But try them, not, as others do, if they were
born of the same parents and nurtured together,
and under the same tutor; but by
this alone, wherein they place their profit,
whether in outward things or in the will.
If in outward things, call them no more
friends than faithful or steadfast or bold or
free; yea, nor even men, if you had sense.
For that opinion hath nothing of humanity
that makes men bite each other, and revile
each other, and haunt the wildernesses, or
the public places, like the mountains,<a name="FNanchor_5_88" id="FNanchor_5_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_88" class="fnanchor">5</a> and
in the courts of justice to show forth the
character of thieves; nor that which makes
men drunkards and adulterers and corruptors,
nor whatever other ills men work against
each other through this one and only opinion,
that They and Theirs lie in matters beyond
the Will. But if you hear, in sooth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
that these men hold the Good to be there
only where the Will is, where the right use
of appearances is, then be not busy to inquire
if they are father and son, or brothers,
or have long time companied with each
other as comrades; but, knowing this one
thing alone, argue confidently that they are
friends, even as they are faithful and upright.
For where else is friendship than where
faith is, where piety is, where there is an
interchange of virtue, and none of other
things than that?</p>

<p>7. <i>But such a one hath shown kindness to me
so long, and is he not my friend?</i> Slave,
whence knowest thou if he did not show
thee kindness as he wipes his shoes or tends
his beast? Whence knowest thou if, when
thy use is at an end as a vessel, he will not
cast thee away like a broken plate? <i>But she
is my wife, and we have lived together so long?</i>
And how long lived Eriphyle with Amphiaraus,
and was the mother, yea, of many
children? But a necklace came between
them.<a name="FNanchor_6_89" id="FNanchor_6_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_89" class="fnanchor">6</a> But what is a necklace? It is the
opinion men have concerning such things.
That was the wild beast nature, that was the
sundering of love, that which would not
allow the woman to be a wife, or the mother
a mother. And of you, whosoever hath
longed either to be a friend himself or to win
some other for a friend, let him cut out these
opinions, let him hate them and drive them
from his soul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>8. And thus he will not revile himself, nor
be at strife with himself, nor be variable,
nor torment himself. And to another, if it
be one like himself, he will be altogether as
to himself, but with one unlike he will be
forbearing and gentle and mild, ready to forgive
him as an ignorant man, as one who is
astray about the greatest things; but harsh
to no man, being well assured of that dogma
of Plato, that no soul is willingly deprived
of the truth.</p>

<p>9. But otherwise you may do all things
whatsoever, even as friends are wont to do,
and drink together, and dwell together, and
voyage together, and be born from the same
parents, for so are snakes; but friends they
are not, nor are ye, so long as ye hold these
accursed doctrines of wild beasts.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">time and change.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Let</span> not another&#8217;s vice be thy evil.
For thou wast not born to be abject with
others, or unfortunate with others, but to
prosper with them. But if any one is unfortunate,
remember that it is of his own
doing. For God hath made all men to be
happy, and of good estate. For this end
hath He granted means and occasions, giving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
some things to each man as his own concern,
and some things as alien; and the things
that are hindered and subject to compulsion
and lost are not his own concern, and those
that are unhindered are; and the substance
of Good and of Evil, as it were worthy of
Him that careth for us and doth protect us
as a father, He hath placed among our own
concerns.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;But I have parted from such a
one, and he is grieved.&#8221;</p>

<p>For why did he deem things alien to be
his own concern? Why, when he rejoiced
to see thee, did he not reason that thou wert
mortal, and apt to travel to another land?
Therefore doth he pay the penalty of his
own folly. But thou, for what cause or
reason dost thou bewail thyself? Hast thou
also given no thought to these things; but
like silly women consorted with all that
pleased thee as though thou shouldst consort
with them forever, places and persons
and pastimes? and now thou sittest weeping,
because thou canst see the same persons
and frequent the same places no longer.
This, truly, is what thou art fit for, to be
more wretched than crows and ravens that
can fly whithersoever they please, and
change their nests, and pass across the seas,
nor ever lament nor yearn for what they
have left.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Yea, but they are thus because they
are creatures without reason.&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>To us, then, was Reason given by the
Gods for our misfortune and misery? that
we should be wretched and sorrowful forever?
Let all men be immortal, forsooth,
and no man migrate to another land, nor let
us ourselves ever migrate, but remain rooted
to one spot like plants; and if one of our
companions go, let us sit down and weep,
and if he return, dance and clap hands like
children!</p>

<p>3. Shall we not now at last wean ourselves,
and remember what we heard from
the philosophers? if, indeed, we did not
listen to them as a wizard&#8217;s incantation.
For they said that the universe is one Polity,
and one is the substance out of which it is
made, and there must, of necessity, be a
certain cycle, and some things must give
place to others, some dissolving away, and
others coming into being, some abiding in
one place, and others being in motion.
But all things are full of love, first of the
Gods, then of men, that are by nature made
to have affection towards each other; and
it must needs be that some dwell with each
other, and some are separated, rejoicing in
those who are with them, and not distressed
for those who go away. And man, they
said, is magnanimous by nature, and contemneth
all things beyond the Will; and
hath also this quality, not to be rooted to
one spot, nor grown into the earth, but able
to go from place to place, sometimes urged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
by divers needs, sometimes for the sake of
what he shall see.</p>

<p>4. And such was the case with Ulysses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The cities of many peoples and minds of men he
knew.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Od.</i> i. 3.</p></div>

<p>And yet earlier with Hercules, who went
about the whole earth&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;All disorders of men and orderly rule to see,&#8221;
&mdash;<i>Od.</i> xvii. 487,</p></div>

<p>casting out and purging the one, and bringing
in the other in its place. And how
many friends, think you, had he in Thebes?
how many in Argos? how many in Athens?
and how many did he gain in his journeyings?
And he took a wife, too, when it
seemed to him due time, and begat children,
and left them behind him, not with lamentations
or regrets, nor leaving them as orphans;
for he knew that no man is an orphan, but
that there is an Eternal Father who careth
continually for all. For not of report alone
had he heard that Zeus is the Father of men,
whom also he thought to be his own father,
and called Him so, and all that he did, he
did looking unto Him. And thus it was that
he was able to live happily in every place.</p>

<p>5. For never can happiness and the longing
for what is not exist together. For
Happiness must have all its will. It is like
unto one that hath eaten and is filled; thirst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
will not sort with it, nor hunger. <i>But Ulysses
longed for his wife, and lamented as he sat on
the rock.</i><a name="FNanchor_1_90" id="FNanchor_1_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_90" class="fnanchor">1</a> And do you, then, follow Homer
and his stories in everything? Or if he did
in truth lament, what else was he than an
unfortunate man? And what good man is
unfortunate? Verily, the Whole is ill-governed
if Zeus taketh no care of his own
citizens, that they like himself may be
happy; but these things it is not lawful nor
pious even to think of. But Ulysses, if
indeed he lamented and complained, was
not a good man. For what good man is
there that knoweth not who he is? and who
knoweth this who forgets that things which
come into existence also perish, and that no
two human beings dwell together forever?
To aim, then, at things which are impossible
is a contemptible and foolish thing; it
is the part of a stranger and alien in God&#8217;s
world who fights against God in the one
way he can&mdash;by his own opinions.</p>

<p>6. <i>But my mother laments if she sees me
not.</i> And wherefore hath she never learned
these teachings? Yet, I say not that it is
no concern of ours to prevent her grieving;
but that we should not absolutely, and without
exception, desire what is not our own.
And the grief of another is another&#8217;s, and
my grief is mine own. I will, therefore,
absolutely end mine own grief, for this I
can; and that of another according to my
means, but this I will not attempt absolutely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
For otherwise I shall be fighting with God.
I shall be opposing and resisting Him in the
government of the Whole; and of this strife
against God, this obstinacy, not only my
children&#8217;s children, but I myself, too, shall
pay the penalty by day and night; for I shall
leap from my bed at visions of the night,
confounded, trembling at every news, having
my peace at the mercy of letters of other persons.
<i>A messenger hath come from Rome;
God grant it be no evil</i>. But what evil can
come upon thee there, where thou art not?
<i>There is a message from Greece; God grant it
be no evil.</i> And thus to thee every place may
be a source of misfortune. Is it not enough
for thee to be unfortunate where thou art,
and not also across the sea, and by writings?
Is this the security of thine affairs? <i>But
what if my friends which are abroad die there?</i>
What else than that creatures destined to die
have died? And how dost thou desire to
live to old age, and never to see the death
of any whom thou lovest? Knowest thou
not that in a great length of time many and
various things must chance; that a fever
shall overthrow one, and a robber another,
and a tyrant another? Such is our environment,
such our companions; cold and heat,
and improper ways of living, and journeyings,
and voyagings, and winds, and various
circumstances will destroy one man, and
exile another, and cast another into an embassy,
and another into a campaign. Sit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
down, then, terrified at all these things;
grieve and fail, and be unfortunate; depend
on others, and that not on one or two, but
myriads upon myriads.</p>

<p>7. Is this what you heard, is this what
you learned from the philosophers? Know
you not that our business here is a warfare?
and one must watch, and one go out as a
spy, and one must fight? All cannot be the
same thing, nor would it be better if they
were. But you neglect to do the bidding of
the commander, and complain when he hath
laid somewhat rougher than common upon
you; and you mark not what, so far as in
you lies, you are making the army to become,
so that if all copy you, none will dig a trench,
none will cast up a rampart, none will watch,
none will run any risk, but each will appear
worthless for warfare. Again, in a ship, if
you go for a sailor, take up one place, and
never budge from it; and if you are wanted
to go aloft, refuse; or to run upon the prow,
refuse; and what captain will have patience
with you? Will he not cast you out like
some useless thing, nothing else than a hindrance
and bad example to the other sailors?</p>

<p>8. And thus here also: the life of every
man is a sort of warfare, and a long one,
and full of divers chances. And it behooveth
a man to play a soldier&#8217;s part, and do all at
the nod of his commander; yea, and if it be
possible, to divine what he intendeth. For
that commander is not such a one as this,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
neither in power nor in exaltation of character.
You are set in a great office, and in no
mean place, but are a Senator forever.
Know you not that such a one can attend
but little to his household, but he must be
oftentimes abroad, ruling or being ruled, or
fulfilling some office, or serving in the field,
or judging? And will you, then, desire to
be fixed and rooted like a plant in the same
place? <i>For it is pleasant.</i> Who denies it?
But so is a dainty pleasant, and a fair woman
is pleasant. How otherwise are those wont
to speak who make pleasure their end? See
you not what kind of men they are whose
words you utter? They are the words of
Epicureans and profligates. And doing the
works of these men, and holding their doctrines,
wilt thou speak to us with the speech
of Zeno and Socrates?</p>

<p>9. Will you not fling away from you as
far as you can these alien sentiments wherewith
you adorn yourself, which beseem you
not at all? What other desire have such
men than to sleep their fill unhindered, and
when they have risen, to yawn for languor,
and wash their face, and write and read
whatever pleaseth them; then have some
trivial talk, and be praised by their friends,
whatever they say; then go forth to walk
about, and having done this a little, go to
the baths; then eat; then retire to rest&mdash;such
a rest as is the wont of such men, and
why need we say what, for it is easily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
guessed? Come, tell me, then, thine own
way of life, such as thou desirest, O thou
votary of the truth, and of Socrates and
Diogenes! What wilt thou do in Athens?
these very things, or others? Why, then,
dost declare thyself a Stoic? Are not they
sorely punished which falsely pretend to be
Roman citizens; and should those go free
who falsely pretend to so great and reverend
a calling and name? or let this indeed
be impossible; but this is the law, divine
and mighty, and not to be escaped, that
layeth the greatest punishments on the
greatest sinners. For what saith this law?
He who pretendeth to things that are not
his own, let him be a cheat and braggart;
he that is disobedient to the divine government,
let him be an abject, a slave, let him
grieve and envy and pity<a name="FNanchor_2_91" id="FNanchor_2_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_91" class="fnanchor">2</a>&mdash;in a word, let
him be misfortunate, and mourn.</p>

<p>10.&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;And now will you have me
attend upon such a one, and hang about his
doors?&#8221;</p>

<p>If Reason demand it, for the sake of country,
of kinsmen, of mankind, wherefore
shouldst thou not go? Thou art not
ashamed to go to the doors of a cobbler
when thou art in want of shoes, nor to those
of a gardener for lettuces; and why to those
of a rich man when thou art in need of some
like thing?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Yea, but I have no awe of the cobbler.&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>Then have none of the rich.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Nor will I flatter the gardener.&#8221;</p>

<p>And do not flatter the rich.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;How, then, shall I gain what I
want?&#8221;</p>

<p>Did I say to thee, <i>Go, for the sake of gaining
it</i>; or did I not only say, <i>Go, that thou
mayest do what it beseems thee to do</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;And why, then, should I yet go?&#8221;</p>

<p>That thou mayest have gone; that thou
mayest have played the part of a citizen, of
a brother, of a friend. And, for the rest,
remember that the shoemaker, the vegetable-seller,
to whom thou didst go, hath
nothing great or exalted to give, even though
he sell it dear. Thy aim was lettuces; they
are worth an obol, they are not worth a
talent. And so it is here. Is the matter
worth going to the rich man&#8217;s door for? So
be it; I will go. Is it worth speaking to
him about? So be it; I will speak. But
must I also kiss his hand, and fawn upon
him with praise? Out upon it! that is a
talent&#8217;s worth. It is no profit to me, nor to
the State, nor to my friends, that they
should lose a good citizen and friend.</p>

<p>11.&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;How, then, shall I become of
an affectionate disposition?&#8221;</p>

<p>In having a generous and happy one.
For Reason doth never decree that a man
must be abject, or lament, or depend on
another, or blame God or man. And thus
be thou affectionate, as one who will keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
this faith. But if through this affection, or
what happens to be so called by thee, thou
art like to prove a miserable slave, then it
shall not profit thee to be affectionate. And
what hinders us to love as though we loved
a mortal, or one who may depart to other
lands? Did Socrates not love his children?
Yea, but as a free man; as one who remembered
that he must first love the Gods. And,
therefore, he never did transgress anything
that it becomes a good man to observe,
neither in his defense, nor in fixing his punishment,
nor beforetime when he was of the
Council, nor when he was serving in the
field. But we are well supplied with every
excuse for baseness; some through children,
some through mothers, some through
brothers. But it behooveth no man to be
unhappy through any person, but happy
through all, and most of all through God,
which hath framed us to that end.</p>

<p>12. And, for the rest, in all things which
are delightful to thee, set before thyself the
appearances that oppose them. What harm
is it, while kissing thy child, to whisper, <i>To-morrow
thou shalt die</i>; and likewise with thy
friend, <i>To-morrow thou shall depart, either
thou or I, and we shall see each other no more</i>?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;But these are words of ill-omen.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so are some incantations, but in that
they are useful I regard not this; only let
them be of use. But dost thou call anything
of ill-omen, save only that which betokeneth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
some evil? Cowardice is a word of ill-omen,
and baseness and grief and mourning
and shamelessness, these words are of
ill-omen. And not even them must we
dread to speak, if so we may defend ourselves
against the things. But wilt thou
say that any word is of ill-omen that betokeneth
some natural thing? Say that it is of
ill-omen to speak of the reaping of ears of
corn, for it betokeneth the destruction of the
ears&mdash;but not of the universe. Say that the
falling of the leaves is of ill-omen, and the
dried fig coming in the place of the green,
and raisins in the place of grapes. For all
these things are changes from the former
estate to another; no destruction, but a certain
appointed order and disposition. Here
is parting for foreign lands, and a little
change. Here is death&mdash;a greater change,
not from that which now is to that which is
not, but to that which is not now.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">on solitude.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Solitude</span> is the state of one who is
helpless. For he who is alone is not therefore
solitary; even as he who is in a great
company is not therefore not solitary.
When, therefore, we have lost a brother or
a son or a friend on whom we were wont<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
to rest, we say that we are left solitary,
and oftentimes we say it in Rome, with such
a crowd meeting us and so many dwelling
about us, and, it may be, having a multitude
of slaves. For the solitary man, in his
conception, meaneth to be thought helpless,
and laid open to those who wish him harm.
Therefore when we are on a journey we
then, above all, say that we are solitary
when we are fallen among thieves; for that
which taketh away solitude is not the sight
of a man, but of a faithful and pious and
serviceable man. For if to be solitary it
sufficeth to be alone, then say that Zeus is
solitary in the conflagration,<a name="FNanchor_1_92" id="FNanchor_1_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_92" class="fnanchor">1</a> and bewails
himself. <i>Woe is me! I have neither Hera
nor Athene nor Apollo</i>, nor, in short, either
brother or son or descendant or kinsman.
And so some say he doth when alone in the
conflagration. For they comprehend not
the life of a man who is alone, setting out
from a certain natural principle, that we are
by nature social, and inclined to love each
other, and pleased to be in the company of
other men. But none the less is it needful
that one find the means to this also, to be
able to suffice to himself, and to be his own
companion. For as Zeus is his own companion,
and is content with himself, and
considereth his own government, what it is,
and is occupied in designs worthy of himself;
thus should we be able to converse
with ourselves, and feel no need of others,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
nor want means to pass the time; but to
observe the divine government, and the
relation of ourselves with other things; to
consider how we stood formerly towards the
events that befall us, and how we stand
now; what things they are that still afflict
us; how these, too, may be healed, how
removed; and if aught should need perfecting,
to perfect it according to the reason of
the case.</p>

<p>2. Ye see now how that C&aelig;sar seemeth
to have given us a great peace; how there
are no longer wars nor battles nor bands of
robbers nor of pirates, but a man may travel
at every season, and sail from east to west.
But can he give us peace from fever? or from
shipwreck? or from fire? or earthquake? or
lightning? ay, or from love? <i>He cannot.</i>
Or from grief? <i>He cannot.</i> Or from envy?
<i>He cannot.</i> Briefly, then, he cannot secure
us from any of such things. But the word
of the philosophers doth promise us peace
even from these things. And what saith it?
<i>If ye will hearken unto me, O men, wheresoever
ye be, whatsoever ye do, ye shall not
grieve, ye shall not be wroth, ye shall not be
compelled or hindered, but ye shall live untroubled
and free from every ill.</i> Whosoever
hath this peace, which C&aelig;sar never proclaimed
(for how could he proclaim it?),
but which God proclaimed through His word,
shall he not suffice to himself when he may
be alone? for he beholdeth and considereth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
<i>Now can no evil happen to me; for me there
is no robber, no earthquake; all things are full
of peace, full of calm; for me no way, no city,
no assembly, no neighbor, no associate hath
any hurt</i>. He is supplied by one, whose
part that is, with food, by another with
raiment, by another with senses, by another
with natural conceptions. And when it
may be that the necessary things are no
longer supplied, that is the signal for retreat:
the door is opened, and God saith to thee,
<i>Depart</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Whither?&#8221;</p>

<p>To nothing dreadful, but to the place from
whence thou camest&mdash;to things friendly and
akin to thee, to the elements of Being. Whatever
in thee was fire shall go to fire; of earth,
to earth; of air, to air; of water, to water;<a name="FNanchor_2_93" id="FNanchor_2_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_93" class="fnanchor">2</a>
no Hades, nor Acheron, nor Coeytus, nor
Phlegethon, but all things are full of Gods
and Powers.<a name="FNanchor_3_94" id="FNanchor_3_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_94" class="fnanchor">3</a> Whoso hath these things to
think on, and seeth the sun and the moon
and the stars, and rejoiceth in the earth and
the sea, he is no more solitary than he is
helpless.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;What, then, if one come and find
me alone and slay me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fool! not thee, but thy wretched body.</p>

<p>3. Thou art a little soul bearing up a
corpse.</p>

<p>4. What solitude, then, is there any
longer, what lack? Why do we make ourselves
worse than children, which, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
they are left alone, what do they?&mdash;they
take shells and sand and build up somewhat,
and then throw it down, and again build up
something else, and so they never lack pastime.
And shall I, if ye sail away from me,
sit down and weep for that I am left alone
and solitary? Shall I have no shells nor
sand? But children do these things through
their folly, and we through our wisdom are
made unhappy.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER X.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">against the contentious and revengeful.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">To</span> suppose that we shall become contemptible
in the eyes of others, unless in
some way we inflict an injury on those who
first showed hostility to us, is the character
of most ignoble and thoughtless men. For
thus we say, that a man is to be despised
according to his inability to do hurt; but
much rather is he to be despised according
to his inability to do good.</p>

<p>2. The wise and good man neither strives
with any himself, nor in the measure of his
power will he allow another to strive. And
in this, as in all other things, the life of
Socrates is set before us as an example; who
did not only himself fly all contention, but
also forbade it to others. See in Xenophon&#8217;s
<i>Symposium</i> how many quarrels he ended;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
and, again, how he bore with Thrasymachus,
and how with Polus and with Callicles; and
how he endured his wife, and how his son,
which opposed him with sophistical arguments.
For he remembered very well that
no man can command the ruling faculty of
another.</p>

<p>3. How, then, is there yet any place for
contention in one so minded? For what
event can amaze him? what appear strange
to him? Doth he not look for even worse
and more grievous things at the hands of
evil men than do befall him? Doth he not
count everything for gain which is short of
the extreme of injury? Hath such a one
reviled thee? Much thanks to him that he
did not strike thee. <i>But he did also strike
me.</i> Much thanks that he did not wound
thee. <i>But he did also wound me.</i> Much
thanks that he did not slay thee. For when
did he learn, or from whom, that he was
a tame animal, and affectionate to others,
and that to the wrongdoer the wrong-doing
itself is a heavy injury? For since he hath
not learned these things, nor believes them,
wherefore should he not follow that which
appears to be his advantage? Thy neighbor
hath flung stones! Hast thou, then,
sinned in aught? But he has broken things
in the house? And art thou a household
vessel? Nay&mdash;but a Will.</p>

<p>4. What, then, hath been given thee for
this occasion? To a wolf it were given to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
bite&mdash;to fling more stones. But if thou seek
what is becoming for a man, look into thy
stores, see what faculties thou hast come
here furnished withal. Hast thou the nature
of a wild beast? the temper of revenge?</p>

<p>5. When is a horse in wretched case?
When he is bereaved of his natural faculties;
not when he cannot crow, but when he cannot
run. When is a dog? Not when he
cannot fly, but when he cannot track. Is
not a man, then, also thus wretched, not
when he cannot strangle lions or embrace
statues<a name="FNanchor_1_95" id="FNanchor_1_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_95" class="fnanchor">1</a>&mdash;for to this he came endowed with
no faculties by Nature&mdash;but when he hath
lost his honesty, his faithfulness? Surely
we should meet together and lament over
such a man; so great are the evils into
which he hath fallen. Not, indeed, that we
should lament for his birth, or for his death,
but in that while yet living he hath suffered
the loss of his own true possessions. I speak
not of his paternal inheritance, not of his
land, or his house, or his inn, or his slaves (for
not one of these things is the true possession
of a man, but all are alien, servile, subject,
given now to some, now to others, by those
that can command them); but of his human
qualities, the stamps of his spirit wherewith
he came into the world. Even such we seek
for also on coins, and if we find them we
approve the coins, and if not, we cast them
away. What is the stamp of this sestertius?
<i>The stamp of Trajan.</i> Then give it me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
<i>The stamp of Nero.</i><a name="FNanchor_2_96" id="FNanchor_2_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_96" class="fnanchor">2</a> Fling it away&mdash;it will
not pass, it is bad. And so here too. What
is the stamp of his mind? He is gentle,
social, forbearing, affectionate. Come,
then, I receive him, I admit him to citizenship,
I receive him as a neighbor, a fellow-traveler.
See to it only that he have not
Nero&#8217;s stamp. Is he wrathful, revengeful,
complaining? Doth he, when it may seem
good to him, break the heads of all who
stand in his way? Why, then, didst thou
say he was a man? Shall everything be
judged by the bare form? If so, then say
that a wax apple is a real apple, and that it
has the smell and taste of an apple. But the
outward shape doth not suffice, nor are eyes
and nose enough to make a man, but he is a
man only if he have a man&#8217;s mind. Here
is one that will not hear reason, that will
not submit when he is confuted&mdash;he is an
ass. In another, reverence hath died&mdash;he
is worthless, anything rather than a man.
This one seeketh whom he may meet and
kick or bite&mdash;so that he is not even a sheep
or an ass, but some kind of savage beast.</p>

<p>6. But this is the nature of every creature,
to pursue the Good and fly the Evil; and to
hold every man an enemy and a plotter for
our woe, were it even a brother, or son, or
father, who takes away from us the one, or
brings us into the other. For nothing is
nearer or dearer to us than the Good. It
remains, therefore, if outward things be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
good and evil, that a father is no longer the
friend of his sons, nor the brother of his
brother, but every place is full of enemies
and plotters and slanderers. But if the only
Good is that the Will should be as it ought to
be, and the only Evil as it ought not, where
is there then any place for strife, for reviling?
For about what things shall we strive?
about those that are nothing to us? and with
whom? with the ignorant, the unhappy,
with men who are deceived concerning the
greatest things?</p>

<p>7. Remembering these things, Socrates
managed his own household, enduring a
most shrewish wife and an undutiful son.
For these doctrines make love in a household,
and concord in a State, peace among
nations, and gratitude towards God, with
boldness in every place, as of one who hath
to do with things alien to him, and of no
estimation. And we are the men to write
and read these things, and to applaud them
when they are delivered to us, but to the
belief of them we have not even come near.
And therefore that saying concerning the
Laced&aelig;monians,</p>

<p>
&#8220;Lions at home, but in Ephesus foxes,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_3_97" id="FNanchor_3_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_97" class="fnanchor">3</a><br />
</p>

<p>will fit us too&mdash;lions in the school and foxes
without.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">End of Book III.</span></h4>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<h3><i>BOOK IV.</i></h3>

<h3><br />CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">of religion.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Of</span> religion towards the Gods, know
that the chief element is to have right opinions
concerning them, as existing and governing
the whole in fair order and justice;
and then to set thyself to obey them, and
to yield to them in each event, and submit
to it willingly, as accomplished under the
highest counsels. For so shalt thou never
blame the Gods, nor accuse them, as being
neglectful of thee.</p>

<p>2. But this may come to pass in no other
way than by placing Good and Evil in the
things that are in our own power, and withdrawing
them from those that are not; for
if thou take any of these things to be good
or evil, then when thou shalt miss thy desire,
or fall into what thou desirest not, it is
altogether necessary that thou blame and
hate those who caused thee to do so.</p>

<p>3. For every living thing was so framed
by Nature as to flee and turn from things,
and the causes of things, that appear hurt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>ful,
and to follow and admire things, and
the causes of things, that appear serviceable.
For it is impossible that one who
thinketh himself harmed should delight in
that seemeth to harm him, even as he cannot
delight in the very harm itself.</p>

<p>4. And thus it comes that a father is reviled
by his son when he will not give him
of the things that appear to be good. And
this it was that set Polyneices and Eteocles
at war with each other&mdash;the opinion,
namely, that royalty is a good. And
through this the Gods are railed on by the
husbandman and the sailor, by the merchant,
and men who lose their wives or
children. For where advantage is, there
also is religion. Thus he who is careful to
pursue and avoid as he ought, is careful, at
the same time, of religion.</p>

<p>5. But it is fitting also that every man
should pour libations and offer sacrifices and
first-fruits after the customs of his fathers,
purely, and not languidly nor negligently,
nor, indeed, scantily, nor yet beyond his
means.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">of providence.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Concerning</span> the Gods, there are some
who say that a Divine Being does not exist;
and others, that it exists indeed, but is idle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
and uncaring, and hath no forethought for
anything; and a third class say that there
is such a Being, and he taketh forethought
also, but only in respect of great and
heavenly things, but of nothing that is on
the earth; and a fourth class, that he
taketh thought of things both in heaven and
earth, but only in general, and not of each
thing severally. And there is a fifth class,
whereof are Odysseus and Socrates, who
say, <i>Nor can I move without thy knowledge</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_98" id="FNanchor_1_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_98" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>2. Before all things, then, it is necessary
to investigate each of these opinions, whether
it be justly affirmed or no. For if there be
no Gods, how can the following of the Gods
be an end? And if there are Gods, but such
as take no care for anything, then also how
can the following of them be truly an end?
And how, again, if the Gods both exist and
take care for things, yet if there be no communication
from them to men, yea, by Zeus,
and even to mine own self? The wise and
good man, having investigated all these
things, will submit his own mind to Him
that governeth the Whole, even as good
citizens to the laws of their State.</p>

<p>3. But a certain man having inquired
how one could be persuaded that every one
of his actions is observed by God, Doth it
not appear to you, said Epictetus, that all
things are united in One?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;It doth so appear.&#8221;</p>

<p>What then? Think you not that a sym<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>pathy
exists between heavenly and earthly
things?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;I do think it.&#8221;</p>

<p>For how else do plants, as if at the command
of God, when He bids them, flower in
due season? and shoot forth when He bids
them shoot, and bear fruit when He bids
them bear? and ripen when He bids them
ripen? and again they drop their fruit when
He bids them drop it, and shed their leaves
when He bids them shed them? and how
else at His bidding do they fold themselves
together, and remain motionless and at rest?
And how else at the waxing and waning of
the moon, and the approach and withdrawal
of the sun, do we behold such a
change and reversal in earthly things? But
are the plants and our bodies so bound up
in the whole, and have sympathy with it,
and are our spirits not much more so? And
our souls being thus bound up and in touch
with God, seeing, indeed, that they are portions
and fragments of Him, shall not every
movement of them, inasmuch as it is something
inward and akin to God, be perceived
by Him? But you are able to meditate upon
the divine government, and upon all divine
and all human affairs, and to be affected at
the same time in the senses and in the intellect
by ten thousand things, and at the
same time to assent to some and dissent to
others, or suspend your judgment; and you
preserve in your mind so many impressions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
of so many and various things, and being
affected by them, you strike upon ideas
similar to earlier impressions, and you retain
many different arts, and memories of
ten thousand things; and shall not God
have the power to overlook all things, and
be present with all, and have a certain communication
with all? But is the sun able
to illuminate so great a part of the All, and
to leave so little without light,&mdash;that part,
namely, which is filled with the shadow of
the earth&mdash;and shall He who made the sun,
and guideth it in its sphere&mdash;a small part of
Him beside the Whole&mdash;shall He not be
capable of perceiving all things?</p>

<p>4. <i>But I</i>, saith the man, <i>cannot take heed
of all these things at once</i>. And who said
you could do this? that you had equal
powers with God? But, nevertheless, He
hath placed at every man&#8217;s side a Guardian,
the Genius of each man,<a name="FNanchor_2_99" id="FNanchor_2_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_99" class="fnanchor">2</a> who is charged to
watch over him, a Genius that cannot sleep,
nor be deceived. To what greater and more
watchful guardian could He have committed
us? So, when ye have shut the doors, and
made darkness in the house, remember never
to say that ye are alone; for ye are not
alone, but God is there, and your Genius is
there; and what need have these of light to
mark what ye are doing? To this God it
were fitting also that ye should swear an
oath, as soldiers do to C&aelig;sar. But those
indeed who receive pay swear to prefer the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
safety of C&aelig;sar before all things; but ye,
receiving so many and great things, will
ye not swear? or swearing, will ye not abide
by it? And what shall ye swear? Never
to disobey, never to accuse, never to blame
aught that He hath given, never unwillingly
to do or suffer any necessary thing. Is this
oath like unto that other? The soldiers
swear to esteem no other man before C&aelig;sar;
ye to esteem yourselves above all.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">of providence.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Marvel</span> not if the other animals have
all things that are needful for the body without
preparation, not alone food and drink,
but sleeping places also, and they have no
need of shoes, nor bedding, nor raiment,
while all these things must needs be added
to us. For these creatures exist not for
themselves, but for service; it were not expedient
that they had been made with need
of such additions. For, look you, what a
task it were for us to take thought, not for
ourselves alone, but also for the sheep and
the asses, how they should be clad, how
shod, how they should eat, how they should
drink! But as soldiers are ready for their
commands, shod, and clothed, and accoutred,
and it would be a grievous thing if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
each captain of a thousand must go round
and shoe or clothe his thousand; so also hath
Nature formed the animals that are made
for service, ready equipped, and needing no
further care. And thus one little child with
a rod will drive the sheep.</p>

<p>2. But now we, neglecting to be grateful,
for that we need not attend to the animals
equally with ourselves, do accuse God for
our own lack. And yet, by Zeus and all
the Gods, there is no one thing in the frame
of Nature but would give, at least to a reverent
and grateful spirit, enough for the perceiving
of the Providence of God. And to
speak of no great things now, consider this
alone, how milk is produced from grass, and
cheese from milk, and wool from skins.
Who is he that hath made these things or
planned them? <i>No one</i>, sayest thou? O
monstrous impudence and dullness!</p>

<p>3. Well, then, let the large works of
Nature pass, and let us look only at her by-works.
Is there aught more useless than
the hairs on the chin? What then? hath
she not made such use even of these, that
nothing could be comelier? hath she not
by them distinguished male from female?
Doth not the nature of every man cry aloud
even at a distance, <i>I am a man, thus shalt
thou approach me, thus speak to me, look for
nothing else; behold the tokens!</i> And again in
women, as Nature hath mingled something
of softness in the voice, so she hath taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
away the hairs. <i>Nay</i>, will you say? <i>but
every creature should have been left undistinguished,
and each of us should proclaim</i>, &#8220;<i>I
am a man</i>?&#8221; But how beautiful is not the
token, and becoming, and reverend? how
much more beautiful than the cock&#8217;s comb?
how much more becoming than the lion&#8217;s
mane? Wherefore it behooveth us to preserve
God&#8217;s tokens, nor to fling them away, nor
to confound, as far as in us lies, the things
that distinguish the sexes.</p>

<p>4. Are these the only works of Providence
in us?&mdash;but what may suffice to rightly
praise and tell them? For had we understanding
thereof, would any other thing
better beseem us, either in company or
alone, than to hymn the Divine Being, and
laud Him and rehearse His gracious deeds?
Should we not, as we dig or plow or eat,
sing this hymn to God, <i>Great is God, who
hath given us such instruments whereby we
shall till the earth; great is God, who hath
given us hands, and swallowing, and the
belly; who maketh us to grow without our
knowledge, and to breathe while we sleep</i>.
These things it were fitting that every man
should sing, and to chant the greatest and
divinest hymns for this, that He hath given
us the power to observe and consider His
works and a Way wherein to walk.<a name="FNanchor_1_100" id="FNanchor_1_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_100" class="fnanchor">1</a> What
then? since the most of you have become
blind, should there not be one to fill this
place, and in the name of all to sing this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
hymn to God? For what else can I do, an
old man and lame, than sing hymns to God?
If I were a nightingale I would do after the
nature of a nightingale; if a swan, after
that of a swan. But now I am a reasoning
creature, and it behooves me to sing the praise
of God: this is my task, and this I do, nor,
as long as it is granted me, will I ever
abandon this post. And you, too, I summon
to join me in the same song.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">god in man.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">God</span> is beneficial. But the Good is
also beneficial. It is likely, then, that where
the essence of God is, there also should be
the essence of the Good. And what is the
essence of God? Flesh? God forbid. A
property in land? God forbid. Fame?
God forbid. Mind, Intelligence, Right
Reason? Even so. Here, then, once for
all, seek the essence of the Good. For surely
you will in no wise seek it in a plant? <i>Nay.</i>
Or in any unreasoning creature? <i>Nay.</i> If,
then, it is sought in a reasoning creature,
wherefore continue to seek it anywhere else
than in the difference between reasoning and
unreasoning creatures?</p>

<p>2. The plants have not so much as the
use of appearances, therefore we speak not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
of the Good in their regard. The Good,
then, needs the power of using appearances.
And this alone? Nay; for if so, say then
that Good and Happiness and Unhappiness
are with the lower animals too. But this
you will not say, and you are right; for
though they possessed the use of appearances
in the highest degree, yet the observing
and considering of this use they do not
possess, and naturally so, for they exist to
serve others, nor have any supreme object
in themselves.<a name="FNanchor_1_101" id="FNanchor_1_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_101" class="fnanchor">1</a> For the ass was not made
for any supreme object in himself? Nay,
but he was made able to bear, because we
had need of a back; and, by Zeus, we had
need moreover that he should walk; wherefore
he received also the power to use appearances,
else had he not been able to walk.
And thereupon the matter stopped. For had
he also received the observing and considering
of the use of appearances, it is clear
that in reason he could no longer have
been subject to us, nor have served those
needs of ours, but he had been our equal
and our like.</p>

<p>3. For use is one thing, and observation
and study is another. God had need of the
other animals to use appearances, but of us
to observe and study appearances. Wherefore
it is enough for them to eat and drink,
and rest and breed, and do whatever else
each of them performs, but to us, to whom
the faculty of observing and studying hath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
also been given, these things are not
enough; but unless we act after a certain
manner and ordinance, and conformably to
the nature and constitution of man, we shall
never attain the end of our being. For
where the constitution is different, different
there also is the task and the end. When,
therefore, the constitution is one for use
alone, then the use, of whatever kind it be,
is enough; but where there is also observing
and studying of the use, then, unless
the due employment of this faculty be
added, the end shall never be gained. What
then? God hath constituted every other
animal, one to be eaten, another to serve for
tilling the land, another to yield cheese,
another to some kindred use; for which
things what need is there of the observing
and studying of appearances, and the ability
to make distinctions in them? But man he
hath brought in to be a spectator of God and
of His works, and not a spectator alone, but
an interpreter of them. Wherefore it is
shameful for a man to begin and to end
where creatures do that are without Reason;
but rather should he begin when they begin,
and end where Nature ends in ourselves.
But she ends in contemplation, in observing
and studying, in a manner of life that is in
harmony with Nature. See to it, then, that
ye die not without having been spectators
of these things.</p>

<p>4. Seek, then, the essence of the Good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
there, where if it be not, thou wilt not say
that the Good is in any other thing.</p>

<p>5. But what? are not those creatures also
works of God? Surely; yet not supreme objects,
yet not parts of the Gods. But thou
art a supreme object, thou art a piece of
God, thou hast in thee something that is a
portion of Him. Why, then, art thou ignorant
of thy high ancestry? Why knowest
thou not whence thou camest? Wilt thou
not remember, in thine eating, who it is
that eats, and whom thou dost nourish? in
cohabiting, who it is that cohabits? in converse,
in exercise, in argument, knowest thou
not that thou art nourishing a God, exercising
a God? Unhappy man! thou bearest
about with thee a God, and knowest it not!
Thinkest thou I speak of some God of gold
and silver, and external to thee? Nay, but
in thyself thou dost bear Him, and seest not
that thou defilest Him with thine impure
thoughts and filthy deeds. In the presence
even of an image of God thou hadst not
dared to do one of those things which thou
dost. But in the presence of God Himself
within thee, who seeth and heareth all
things, thou art not ashamed of the things
thou dost both desire and do, O thou unwitting
of thine own nature, and subject to the
wrath of God?</p>

<p>6. Why, then, do we fear in sending
forth a young man from the school into
some of the business of life, lest he should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
do wrong in anything, and be luxurious or
profligate, and lest a wrapping of rags degrade
him, or fine raiment uplift him? Such
a one knoweth not his own God, nor with
whom he is setting out. But can we have
patience with him, saying, <i>Would that I had
you with me!</i><a name="FNanchor_2_102" id="FNanchor_2_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_102" class="fnanchor">2</a> And hast thou not God with
thee there? or having Him, dost thou seek
for any other? or will He speak other things
to thee than even these?</p>

<p>7. But wert thou a statue of Pheidias, an
Athena or Zeus, then wert thou mindful
both of thyself and of the artist; and if thou
hadst any consciousness, thou wouldst strive
to do nothing unworthy of thy maker nor of
thyself, nor ever to appear in any unseemly
guise. But now that Zeus hath made thee,
thou carest therefore nothing what kind of
creature thou showest thyself for? And
yet, is the one Artist like the other artist, or
the one work like the other work? And
what kind of work is that which hath in
itself the faculties that were manifest in the
making of it? Do not artists work in stone
or brass or gold or ivory? and the Athena
of Pheidias, when she hath once stretched
out her hand and received upon it the figure
of Victory, standeth thus for all time? But
the works of God have motion and breathing,
and the use of appearances and the
judgment of them. Wilt thou dishonor
such a Maker, whose work thou art? Nay,
for not only did He make thee, but to thee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
alone did He trust and commit thyself.
Wilt thou not remember this too, or wilt thou
dishonor thy charge? But if God had
committed some orphan child to thee,
wouldst thou have neglected it? Now He
hath given thee to thyself, and saith, <i>I had
none more worthy of trust than thee; keep
this man such as he was made by nature&mdash;reverent,
faithful, high, unterrified, unshaken
of passions, untroubled</i>. And thou wilt not.</p>

<p>8. But they may say: <i>Whence doth this
fellow bring us that eye of scorn and solemn
looks?</i> I have it not yet as I should, For
I am yet unbold in those things which I
have learned and assented to; I yet fear my
weakness. But let me be bold in them, and
then ye shall see such a look, such a guise,
as behooveth me to wear. Then shall I show
you the statue when it is perfected and
polished. What look ye for?&mdash;an eye of
scorn? God forbid! For doth the Zeus in
Olympia look scornfully?&mdash;nay, but his
glance is steadfast, as becometh him who
will say,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;None trusts in vain my irrevocable word.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Il.</i> i. 526.</p></div>

<p>Such will I show myself to you&mdash;faithful,
reverent, generous, untroubled. <i>Not also,
then, deathless, ageless, deceaseless?</i> Nay,
but dying as God, sickening as a God.
These I have, these I can; but other things
I neither have nor can. I will show you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
the thews of a philosopher. And what are
these? A pursuit that never fails, an avoidance
that never miscarries, seemly desire,
studious resolve, cautious assent.<a name="FNanchor_3_103" id="FNanchor_3_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_103" class="fnanchor">3</a> These

<p>1. <span class="smcap">When</span> thou goest to inquire of an oracle,
remember that what the event will be thou
knowest not, for this is the thing thou art
come to learn from the seer; but of what
nature it is (if haply thou art a philosopher),
thou knewest already in coming. For if it
be any of those things that are not in our
own power, it follows of necessity that it
can be neither good nor evil.</p>

<p>2. Bring, therefore, to the seer neither
pursuit nor avoidance, nor go before him
with trembling, but well knowing that all
events are indifferent and nothing to thee.
For whatever it may be, it shall lie with
thee to use it nobly; and this no man can
prevent. Go, then, with a good courage to
the Gods as to counselors; and for the
rest, when anything hath been counseled
thee, remember of whom thou hast taken
counsel, and whom thou wilt be slighting if
thou art not obedient.</p>

<p>3. Therefore, as Socrates would have it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
go to the oracle for those matters only where
thy whole inquiry bendeth solely towards
the event, and where there are no means
either from reason or any other art for
knowing beforehand what is to happen.
Thus, when it may be needful to share
some peril with thy friend or thy country,
inquire of no oracle whether thou shouldst
do the thing. For if the seer should declare
that the sacrifices are inauspicious, this signifies
clearly either death, or the loss of
some limb, or banishment; yet doth Reason
decree that even so thou must stand by thy
friend, and share thy country&#8217;s danger.</p>

<p>4. Mark, therefore, that greater seer, the
Pythian, who cast out of his temple one
that, when his friend was being murdered,
did not help him.<a name="FNanchor_2_105" id="FNanchor_2_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_105" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<h3><i>BOOK V.</i></h3>

<h3><br />CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the behaviour of a philosopher.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Ordain</span> for thyself forthwith a certain
form and type of conduct, which thou shalt
maintain both alone and, when it may
chance, among men.</p>

<p>2. And for the most part keep silence, or
speak only what is necessary, and in few
words. But when occasion may call thee to
speak, then speak, but sparingly, and not
about any subject at hap-hazard, nor about
gladiators, nor horse races, nor athletes, nor
things to eat and drink, which are talked of
everywhere; but, above all, not about men,
as blaming or praising or comparing them.</p>

<p>If, then, thou art able, let thy discourse
draw that of the company towards what is
seemly and good. But if thou find thyself
apart among men of another sort, keep
silence.</p>

<p>3. Laugh not much, nor at many things,
nor unrestrainedly.</p>

<p>4. Refuse altogether, if thou canst, to
take an oath; if thou canst not, then as the
circumstances allow.<a name="FNanchor_1_106" id="FNanchor_1_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_106" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>5. Shun banquets given by strangers and
by the vulgar. But if any occasion bring
thee to them, give strictest heed, lest thou
fall unawares into the ways of the vulgar.
For know that if thy companion be corrupt,
he who hath conversation with him must
needs be corrupted also, even if himself
should chance to be pure.</p>

<p>6. Hath any of you the art of a lute-player
when he takes the lute in his hand, so as at
once when he hath touched the strings to
know which are out of tune, and then to
tune the instrument?&mdash;such a gift as Socrates
had, who in every company could lead
those that were with him to his own topic?
Whence should you have it? but ye must
needs be carried about hither and thither by
the vulgar. And wherefore, then, are they
stronger than ye? For that they speak their
sorry stuff from belief; but ye, your fine talk
from the lips out. Wherefore it is flat and
dead; and sickening it is to hear your exhortations
and this wretched virtue of yours,
which is prated of in every quarter. And
thus the vulgar conquer you. For everywhere
belief is mighty, belief is invincible.
Until then the right opinions are hardened
in you; and until ye shall have gained a
certain strength for your safety, I counsel
you to mingle cautiously with the vulgar,
else every day, like wax in the sun, shall
whatever hath been written in you in the
school be melted away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<p>7. In things that concern the body accept
only so far as the bare need&mdash;as in food,
drink, clothing, habitation, servants. But
all that makes for glory or luxury thou must
utterly proscribe.</p>

<p>8. Concerning intercourse of the sexes,
it is right to be pure before marriage, to the
best of thy power. But, using it, let a man
have to do only with what is lawful. Yet
be not grievous to those who use such
pleasures, nor censorious; nor be often
putting thyself forward as not using them.</p>

<p>9. If one shall bear thee word that such
a one hath spoken evil of thee, then do not
defend thyself against his accusations, but
make answer: <i>He little knew my other vices,
or he had not mentioned only these</i>.</p>

<p>10. There is no necessity to go often to
the arena, but if occasion should take thee
there, do not appear ardent on any
man&#8217;s side but thine own; that is to say,
choose that only to happen which does
happen, and that the conqueror may be
simply he who wins; for so shalt thou not
be thwarted. But from shouting and laughing
at this or that, or violent gesticulation,
thou must utterly abstain. And when thou
art gone away, converse little on the things
that have passed, so far as they make not
for thine own correction. For from that it
would appear that admiration of the spectacle
had overcome thee.</p>

<p>11. Go not freely nor indiscriminately to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
recitations.<a name="FNanchor_2_107" id="FNanchor_2_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_107" class="fnanchor">2</a> But if thou go, then preserve
(yet without being grievous to others) thy
gravity and calmness.</p>

<p>12. When thou art about to meet any one,
especially one of those that are thought high
in rank, set before thy mind what Socrates
or Zeno had done in such a case. And so
thou wilt not fail to deal as it behooves thee
with the occasion.</p>

<p>13. When thou goest to any of those that
are great in power, set before thy mind the
case that thou wilt not find him at home,
that thou wilt be shut out, that the doors
may be slammed in thy face, that he will
take no notice of thee. And if even with
these things it behooves thee to go, then go,
and bear all that happens; and never say
to thyself&mdash;<i>It was not worth this</i>. For that
is the part of the foolish, and of those that
are offended at outward things.</p>

<p>14. In company, be it far from thee to
dwell much and over-measure on thine own
deeds and dangers. For to dwell on thine
own dangers is pleasant indeed to thee, but
not equally pleasant for others is it to hear
of the things that have chanced to thee.</p>

<p>15. Be it far from thee to move laughter.
For that habit is a slippery descent into
vulgarity;<a name="FNanchor_3_108" id="FNanchor_3_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_108" class="fnanchor">3</a> and it is always enough to relax
thy neighbors&#8217; respect for thee.</p>

<p>16. And it is dangerous to approach to
vicious conversation. Therefore, when anything
of the kind may arise, rebuke, if there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
is opportunity, him who approaches thereto.
But if not, then at least by silence and blushing
and grave looks, let it be plain that his
talk is disagreeable to thee.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER II</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">on habit.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Every</span> skill and faculty is maintained
and increased by the corresponding acts;
as, the faculty of walking by walking, of
running by running. If you will read aloud
well, then do it constantly; if you will write,
then write. But when you have not read
aloud for thirty days together, but done
something else, you shall see the result.
Thus, if you have lain down for ten days,
then rise up and endeavor to walk a good
distance, and you shall see how your legs
are enfeebled. In general, then, if you would
make yourself skilled in anything, then do
it; and if you would refrain from anything,
then do it not, but use yourself to do rather
some other thing instead of it.</p>

<p>2. And thus it is in spiritual things also.
When thou art wrathful, know that not this
single evil hath happened to thee, but that
thou hast increased the aptness to it, and,
as it were, poured oil upon the fire. When
thou art overcome in passion, think not that
this defeat is all; but thou hast nourished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
thine incontinence, and increased it. For it
is impossible but that aptitudes and faculties
should spring up where they were not before,
or spread and grow mightier, by the corresponding
acts. And thus, surely, do also,
as the philosopher says, the infirmities of
the soul grow up. For when thou hast
once been covetous of money, if Reason,
which leadeth to a sense of the vice, be
called to aid, then both the desire is set at
rest, and our ruling faculty is re-established,
as it was in the beginning. But if thou
bring no remedy to aid, then shall the soul
return no more to the first estate; but when
next excited by the corresponding appearance,
shall be kindled to desire even more
quickly than before. And when this is continually
happening, the soul becomes callous
in the end, and through its infirmity the
love of money is strengthened. For he
that hath had a fever, when the illness hath
left him, is not what he was before his fever,
unless he have been entirely healed. And
somewhat on this wise also it happens in
the affection of the soul: certain traces and
scars are left in it, the which if a man do
not wholly eradicate, when he hath been
again scoured on the same place, it shall
make no longer scars, but sores.</p>

<p>3. Wouldst thou, then, be no longer of a
wrathful temper? Then do not nourish the
aptness to it, give it nothing that will increase
it, be tranquil from the outset, and number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
the days when thou hast not been wrathful.
<i>I have not been wrathful now for one, nor for
two, nor for three days</i>; but if thou have saved
thirty days, then sacrifice to God. For the
aptness is at first enfeebled, and then destroyed.
<i>To-day I was not vexed, nor to-morrow,
nor for two or three months together;
but I was heedful when anything
happened to move me thus.</i> Know that thou
art in good case. To-day, when I saw a
fair woman, I did not say to myself, <i>Would
that one could possess her</i>; nor, <i>Happy is her
husband</i>, for he who saith this saith also,
<i>Happy is her paramour</i>; nor do I picture to
my mind what should follow. But I stroke
my head, and say, <i>Well done, Epictetus! you
have solved a fine sophism, finer by far than
the master sophism</i>. But if she were also
willing and consenting, and sent to me, and
if she also laid hold of me, and drew
near to me, and I should yet restrain myself
and conquer, this were indeed then a sophism
above the Liar, above the Quiescent.
Verily, for this a man&#8217;s spirit may rightly
swell, and not for propounding the master
sophism.<a name="FNanchor_1_109" id="FNanchor_1_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_109" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>4. How, then, may this come to pass?
Resolve at last to seek thine own commendation,
to appear fair in the eyes of God;
desire to become pure with thine own pure
self, and with God. Then when thou shalt
fall in with any appearance such as we have
spoken of, what saith Plato? Go to the <i>puri</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span><i>fying
sacrifices, go and pray in the temples
of the protecting Gods</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_110" id="FNanchor_2_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_110" class="fnanchor">2</a> It shall even suffice
if thou seek the company of good and wise
men, and try thyself by one of them,
whether he be one of the living or of the
dead.</p>

<p>5. By opposing these remedies thou shalt
conquer the appearance, nor be led captive
by it. But at the outset, be not swept away
by the vehemence of it; but say, <i>Await me a
little, thou appearance; let me see what thou
art, and with what thou hast to do; let me
approve thee</i>. And then permit it not to
lead thee forward, and to picture to thee
what should follow, else it shall take possession
of thee, and carry thee whithersoever
it will. But rather bring in against it
some other fair and noble appearance, and
therewithal cast out this vile one. And if
thou use to exercise thyself in this way, thou
shalt see what shoulders and nerves and
sinews thou wilt have! But now we have
only wordiness, and nothing more.</p>

<p>6. This is the true athlete,<a name="FNanchor_3_111" id="FNanchor_3_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_111" class="fnanchor">3</a> he who exerciseth
himself against such appearances.
Hold, unhappy man! be not swept away.
Great is the contest, divine the task, for
kingship, for freedom, for prosperity, for
tranquillity. Be mindful of God, call Him
to be thy helper and defender, as men at sea
call upon the Dioscuri in a storm.<a name="FNanchor_4_112" id="FNanchor_4_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_112" class="fnanchor">4</a> For
what greater tempest is there than that
which proceedeth from appearances, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
mightily overcome and expel the Reason?
Yea, a storm itself, what is it but an appearance?
For, take away only the dread of death,
and bring as many thunderings and lightnings
as thou wilt, and thou shalt see what fair
weather and calm there will be in the ruling
faculty. But if having been once defeated,
thou shalt say, <i>The next time I will conquer</i>;
and then the same thing over again, be
sure that in the end thou wilt be brought
to such a sorry and feeble state that henceforth
thou wilt not so much as know that
thou art sinning; but thou wilt begin to
make excuses for the thing, and then confirm
that saying of Hesiod to be true:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;With ills unending strives the putter off.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i8">&mdash;<i>Works and Days</i>, 411.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>7. What then? can a man make this resolve,
and so stand up faultless? He cannot;
but this much he can&mdash;to be ever straining
towards faultlessness. For happy it
were if, by never relaxing this industrious
heed, we shall rid ourselves of at least a few
of our faults. But now, when thou sayest,
<i>From to-morrow I shall be heedful</i>, know that
this is what thou art saying:&mdash;<i>To-day I shall
be shameless, importunate, abject; it shall be in
others&#8217; power to afflict me; to-day I shall be
wrathful, envious</i>. Lo, to how many vices
dost thou give place! But if aught be well
to-morrow, how much better to-day? if to-morrow
suit, how much better to-day? Yea,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
and for this, too, that thou mayest have the
power to-morrow, and not again put it off
till the third day.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">on disputation.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">What</span> things a man must have learned
in order to be able to reason well have been
accurately defined by our philosophers; but
in the fitting use of them we are wholly unexercised.
Give any one of us whom ye
please some ignorant man for a disputant,
and he shall find no way to deal with him;
but if, when he hath moved him a little, the
man answer beside the purpose, he is no
longer able to manage him, but either he
will revile him, or mock him, and say, <i>He
is an ignorant fellow; nothing can be done
with him</i>.</p>

<p>2. But a guide, when he hath found one
straying from the way, leads him into the
proper road, and does not mock him or revile
him, and then go away. And do thou
show such a man the truth, and thou shalt
see that he will follow it. But so long as
thou dost not show it, mock him not, but
be sensible rather of thine own incapacity.</p>

<p>3. But what? this business of instruction
is not very safe at present, and least of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
in Rome; for he who pursues it will of
course feel constrained not to do it in a
corner, but he must go to some man of consular
rank, it may be, or some rich man,
and inquire of him: Sir, can you tell me to
whom you have committed the care of your
horses? <i>Surely.</i> Was it, then, to any
chance-comer and one inexperienced about
horses? <i>By no means.</i> Well, then, to whom
are your gold and silver vessels and raiment
entrusted? <i>Neither are these committed to
any chance person.</i> And your body, have
you already sought out one to whom to commit
the care of it? <i>How not?</i> And that
also one who is experienced in training and
medicine? <i>Assuredly.</i> Whether, now, are
these the best things you have, or do you
possess aught that is better than all of them?
<i>What thing do you mean?</i> That, by Zeus,
which useth all these, and approveth each
of them and taketh counsel? <i>Is it the soul,
then, that you mean?</i> You have conceived
me rightly; it is even this. <i>Truly I hold
that I possess in this something much better
than everything else.</i> Can you then declare
to us in what manner you have taken
thought for your soul? for it is not
likely that a wise man like yourself, and one
of repute in the State, would overlook the
best think you possess, and use no diligence
or design about it, but leave it
neglected and perishing? <i>Surely not.</i> But
do you provide for it yourself? and have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
you learned the way from another, or discovered
it yourself?</p>

<p>4. And then at last there is danger lest he
say first, <i>Good sir, what is this to you? who
are you?</i> and then, if you persist in troubling
him, that he may lift up his hands and
smite you. Once I too was an admirer of
this method until I fell into these difficulties.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">that we should be slow in accepting pleasure.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">When</span> thou hast received the appearance
of some pleasure, then, as in other
things, guard thyself lest thou be carried
away by it, but delay with thyself a little,
and let the thing await thee for a while.
Then bethink thyself of the two periods of
time, one when thou shalt be enjoying the
pleasure, the other, when, having enjoyed
it, thou shalt afterwards repent of it and reproach
thyself. And set on the other side
how thou shalt rejoice and commend thyself
if thou abstain.</p>

<p>2. But if it seem reasonable to thee to do
the thing, beware lest thou have been conquered
by the flattery and the sweetness and
the allurement of it. But set on the other
side how much better were the consciousness
of having won that victory.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">that we should be open in our dealings.</span></h4>

<p>In doing aught which thou hast clearly
discerned as right to do, seek never to avoid
being seen in the doing of it, even though
the multitude should be destined to form
some wrong opinion concerning it. For if
thou dost not right, avoid the deed itself.
But if rightly, why fear those who will
wrongly rebuke thee?</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">that half true may be all false.</span></h4>

<p>As the sayings, <i>It is day</i>, <i>It is night</i>, are
wholly justifiable if viewed disjunctively,<a name="FNanchor_1_113" id="FNanchor_1_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_113" class="fnanchor">1</a>
but not if viewed together, even so at a feast,
to pick out the largest portion for one&#8217;s self
may be justifiable, if we look to the needs
of the body alone, but is unjustifiable if
viewed as it concerns the preservation of the
proper community in the feast. Therefore,
in eating with another person, remember
not to look only at the value for the body of
the things that are set before thee, but to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
preserve also the reverence due to the giver
of the feast.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">that each man play his own part.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">If</span> thou hast assumed a part beyond
thy power to play, then thou hast both
come to shame in that, and missed one thou
couldst have well performed.</p>

<p>2. And some one having inquired, <i>How
then, shall each of us perceive what character
he befits?</i> Whence, said Epictetus,
doth the bull alone, when the lion approacheth,
discover his own capacity, and
advance to defend the whole herd? It is
clear that with the capacity is ever joined
the perception of the same, and thus, whoever
of us may possess a like capacity will
not be ignorant of it. But a bull is not made
in a moment, nor is a man of generous spirit;
but we must have preparation and winter-training,<a name="FNanchor_1_114" id="FNanchor_1_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_114" class="fnanchor">1</a>
and not lightly rush upon things
that do not concern us.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">that we should be careful of the soul as of
the body.</span></h4>

<p>In going about, you are careful not to step
upon a nail or to twist your foot. Care thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
also lest you injure your ruling faculty.
And if we observe this in each thing we do,
we shall the more safely undertake it.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the measure of gain.</span></h4>

<p>The measure of gain for each man is the
body, as the foot is for the shoe. Take
your stand on this, and you shall preserve
the measure. But if you transgress it, you
must thenceforth be borne, as it were, down
a steep. And so it is with the shoe, for if
you will go beyond the measure of the foot,
the shoe will be first gilded, then dyed
purple, then embroidered. For that which
hath once transgressed its measure hath no
longer any limit.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER X.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">the worth of women.</span></h4>

<p>From the age of fourteen years women are
flattered and worshiped by men. Seeing
thus that there is nothing else for them but
to serve the pleasure of men, they begin to
beautify themselves, and to place all their
hopes in this. It were well, then, that they
should perceive themselves to be prized for
nothing else than modesty and decorum.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">a dull nature.</span></h4>

<p>It betokens a dull nature to be greatly occupied
in matters that concern the body, as to
be much concerned about exercising one&#8217;s
self, or eating, or drinking, or other bodily
acts. But these things should be done by
the way, and all attention be given to the
mind.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">of adornment of the person.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">A</span> certain young man, a rhetorician,
having come to Epictetus with his hair
dressed in an unusually elaborate way, and
his other attire much adorned, Tell me, said
Epictetus, think you not that some dogs are
beautiful, and some horses, and so of the
other animals?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;I do think it,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>And men too&mdash;are not some beautiful and
some ill-favored?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;How otherwise?&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether, then, do we call each of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
beautiful for the same reasons and in the
same kind, or each for something proper to
itself? And you shall see the matter thus:
Inasmuch as we observe a dog to be formed
by nature for one end, and a horse for
another, and, let us say, a nightingale for
another, we may in general say, not unreasonably,
that each of them is then beautiful
when it is excellent according to its own
nature; but since the nature of each is different,
different also, it seems to me, is the
manner of being beautiful in each. Is it
not so?</p>

<p>He acknowledged that it was.</p>

<p>Therefore, that which maketh a dog beautiful
maketh a horse ill-favored; and that
which maketh a horse beautiful, a dog ill-favored;
if, indeed, their natures are different?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;So it seems.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that which maketh a beautiful Pancratiast,<a name="FNanchor_1_115" id="FNanchor_1_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_115" class="fnanchor">1</a>
the same maketh a wrestler not
good, and a runner utterly laughable? And
he who is beautiful for the Pentathlon is very
bad for wrestling?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;It is so,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>What is it, then, that makes a man beautiful?
Is it not that which, in its kind,
makes also a dog or a horse beautiful?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;It is that,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>What, then, makes a dog beautiful? The
presence of the virtue of a dog. And a
horse? The presence of the virtue of a horse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
And what, then, a man? Is it not also the
presence of the virtue of a man? And, O
youth, if thou wouldst be beautiful, do thou
labor to perfect this, the virtue of a human
being. But what is it? Look whom you
praise when you praise any without affection&mdash;is
it the righteous or the unrighteous?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;The righteous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Is it the temperate or the profligate?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;The temperate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Is it the continent or the incontinent?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;The continent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then making yourself such a one as you
praise, you will know that you are making
yourself beautiful; but so long as you neglect
these things, though you sought out every
device to appear beautiful, you must of
necessity be ugly.</p>

<p>2. For thou art not flesh and hair, but a
Will: if thou keep this beautiful, then wilt
thou be beautiful. But so far I dare not tell
thee that thou art ugly, for I think thou wilt
more easily bear to hear anything else than
this. But see what Socrates saith to Alcibiades,
the most beautiful and blooming of
men: <i>Endeavor, then, to be beautiful</i>; and
what saith he? <i>Curl thy locks, and pluck out
the hairs of thy legs?</i> God forbid. But <i>Set
thy Will in order, cast out evil doctrines</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;And how then shall we deal with
the body?&#8221;</p>

<p>As nature made it. Another hath cared
for this; commit it to Him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;But what? Shall the body then be
uncleansed?&#8221;</p>

<p>God forbid. But that which thou art and
wast made by Nature, cleanse this; let a
man be clean as a man, a woman as a
woman, a child as a child.</p>

<p>3. For we ought not even by the aspect
of the body to scare away the multitude from
philosophy; but by his body, as in all other
things, a philosopher should show himself
cheerful, and free from troubles. <i>Behold,
friends, how I have nothing and need nothing;
behold how I am homeless and landless,
and an exile</i>, if so it chance, <i>and hearthless,
and yet I live more free from troubles than all
the lordly and the rich. But look on my
body, too; ye see that it is not the worse for
my hard life.</i> But if one saith this to me,
having the countenance and garb of a condemned
criminal, what God shall persuade
me to approach to philosophy which makes
such men as this? God forbid! I would
not, were it even to become a sage.</p>

<p>4. I, indeed, by the Gods, had rather a
young man in his first movement towards
philosophy came to me with his hair curled
than disheveled and foul. For a certain
impression of the beautiful is to be seen in
him, and an aim at what is becoming; and
to the thing wherein it seemeth to him to
lie, there he applies his art. Thenceforth it
only needs to show him its true place, and
to say, <i>Young man, thou seekest the beautiful,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
and thou dost well. Know, then, that it flourishes
there where thy Reason is; there seek it
where are thy likes and dislikes, thy pursuits
and avoidances, for this is what thou hast in
thyself of choice and precious, but the body is
by nature mud. Why dost thou spend thy
labor upon it in vain? for that the body is
naught, Time shall certainly teach thee, though
it teach thee nothing else.</i> But if one come to
me foul and filthy, and a mustache down
to the knees, what have I to say to him?
with what image or likeness can I draw him
on? For with what that is like unto Beauty
hath he ever busied himself, so as I may set
him on another course, and say, <i>Not here is
Beauty, but there</i>? Will you have me tell him,
<i>Beauty consists not in being befouled, but in the
Reason</i>? For doth he even seek Beauty?
hath he any impression of it in his mind?
Go, and reason with a hog, that he shall not
roll himself in the mud.</p>

<p>5. Behold a youth worthy of love&mdash;behold
an old man worthy to love, and to be loved
in return; to whom one may commit his
sons, his daughters, to be taught; to whom
young men may come, if it please you&mdash;that
he may deliver lectures to them on a dunghill!
God forbid. Every extravagance
arises from something in human nature, but
this is near to being one that is not human.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">why we should bear with wrong.</span></h4>

<p>When some one may do you an injury, or
speak ill of you, remember that he either
does it or speaks it believing that it is right
and meet for him to do so. It is not possible,
then, that he can follow the thing that
appears to you, but the thing that appears
to him. Wherefore, if it appear evil to him,
it is he that is injured, being deceived. For
also if any one should take a true consequence
to be false, it is not the consequence
that is injured, but he which is deceived.
Setting out, then, from these opinions, you
will bear a gentle mind towards any man
who may revile you. For, say on each occasion,
<i>So it appeared to him</i>.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">that everything hath two handles.</span></h4>

<p>Every matter hath two handles&mdash;by the
one it may be carried; by the other, not.
If thy brother do thee wrong, take not this
thing by the handle, <i>He wrongs me</i>; for that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
is the handle whereby it may not be carried.
But take it rather by the handle, <i>He is my
brother, nourished with me</i>; and thou wilt
take it by a handle whereby it may be
carried.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">on certain false conclusions.</span></h4>

<p>There is no true conclusion in these reasonings:
<i>I am richer than thou, therefore I
am better</i>: <i>I am more eloquent than thou,
therefore I am better</i>. But the conclusions
are rather these: <i>I am richer than thou,
therefore my wealth is better</i>: <i>I am more eloquent
than thou, therefore my speech is better</i>.
But thou art not wealth, and thou art not
speech.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">perception and judgment.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Doth</span> a man bathe himself quickly?
Then, say not, <i>Wrongly</i>, but <i>Quickly</i>. Doth he
drink much wine? Then say not, <i>Wrongly</i>,
but <i>Much</i>. For whence do you know if it
were ill done till you have understood his
opinion?</p>

<p>2. Thus it shall not befall you to assent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
to any other things than those whereof you
are truly and directly sensible.<a name="FNanchor_1_116" id="FNanchor_1_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_116" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>3. What is the cause of assenting to anything?
The appearance that it is so. But
if it appear to be not so, it is impossible to
assent to it. Wherefore? For that this is
the nature of the mind, to receive the true
with favor, the false with disfavor, and
the uncertain with indifference. The proof
of this? Be sure, if you can, at this moment,
that it is night. You cannot. Cease to be
sure that it is day. You cannot. Be sure
that the stars are odd in number, or that
they are even. You cannot. When, therefore,
any man shall assent to what is false,
know that he had no will to consent to falsehood;
for, as saith Plato, no soul is willingly
deprived of the truth, but the false appeared
to it to be true. Come, then, what have we
in actions corresponding to this true and
false? The seemly and the unseemly, the
profitable and the unprofitable, that which
concerns me and that which doth not concern
me, and such like. Can any man think
that a certain thing is for his profit, and not
elect to do it? He cannot. How, then, is it
with her who saith&mdash;</p>

<p>
&#8220;And will I know the evils I shall do,<br />
But wrath is lord of all my purposes?&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Medea</i>, 1079.<br />
</p>

<p>For, did she hold this very thing, to gratify
her wrath and avenge herself on her husband<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
more profitable than to spare her children?
Even so: but she was deceived. Show her
clearly that she was deceived, and she will
not do it; but so long as you show it not,
what else hath she to follow than the thing
as it appears to her? Nothing. Wherefore,
then, have you indignation with her, that
the unhappy wretch has gone astray concerning
the greatest things, and has become
a viper instead of a human being? If anything,
will you not rather pity, as we pity
the blind and the lame, those that are blinded
and lamed in the chiefest of their faculties?</p>

<p>4. &mdash;&mdash;&#8220;So that all these great and dreadful
deeds have this same origin in the appearance
of the thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>The same, and no other. The <i>Iliad</i> is
nought but appearance, and the use of appearances.
The thing that appeared to Paris
was the carrying off of the wife of Menelaus;
the thing that appeared to Helen was to
accompany him. Had it, then, appeared
to Menelaus to be sensible that it was a gain
to be deprived of such a wife, what would
have happened? Not only had there been
no <i>Iliad</i>, but no <i>Odyssey</i> neither.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;On such a little thing do such great
ones hang?&#8221;</p>

<p>But what talk is this of great things?
Wars and seditions and destructions of many
men, and overthrow of cities? And what
is there of great in these? Nothing. For
what is there of greatness in the deaths of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
many oxen and sheep, and the burning or
overthrow of many nests of swallows or
storks?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;But are these things like unto
those?&#8221;</p>

<p>They are most like. The bodies of men
are destroyed, and the bodies of oxen and of
sheep. The dwellings of men are burned,
and the nests of storks. What is there great,
what is there awful in this? Or show me
wherein differeth the dwelling of a man, as
a dwelling, from the nest of a stork, save
that the one buildeth his little houses of
planks and tiles and bricks, and the other of
sticks and mud?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Are a stork and a man, then,
alike?&#8221;</p>

<p>What say you? In body they are most
like.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Doth a man, then, differ in no respect
from a stork?&#8221;</p>

<p>God forbid; but in these matters there is
no difference.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Wherein, then, doth he differ?&#8221;</p>

<p>Seek, and you shall find that in another
thing there is a difference. Look if it be
not in the observing and studying of what
he doth; look if it be not in his social instinct,
in his faith, his reverence, his steadfastness,
his understanding. Where, then,
is the great Good or Evil for man? There,
where the difference is. If this be saved,
and abide, as it were, in a fortress, and rev<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>erence
be not depraved, nor faith, nor understanding,
then is the man also saved.
But if one of these things perish, or be taken
by storm, then doth the man also perish.
And in this it is that great actions are done.
It was a mighty downfall, they say, for
Paris, when the Greeks came, and when
they sacked Troy, and when his brothers
perished. Not so: for through another&#8217;s
act can no man fall&mdash;that was the sacking
of the storks&#8217; nests. But the downfall was
then when he lost reverence and faith, when
he betrayed hospitality and violated decorum.
When was the fall of Achilles?
When Patroclus died? God forbid; but when
he was wrathful, when he bewept the loss
of his girl, when he forgot that he was there
not to win mistresses but to make war.
These, for men, are downfall and storming
and overthrow, when right opinions are demolished
or depraved.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">that the philosopher shall exhibit to the
vulgar deeds, not words.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Thou</span> shalt never proclaim thyself a
philosopher, nor speak much among the
vulgar of the philosophic maxims; but do
the things that follow from the maxims.
For example, do not discourse at a feast upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
how one ought to eat, but eat as one ought.
For remember that even so Socrates everywhere
banished ostentation, so that men used
to come to him desiring that he would recommend
them to teachers of philosophy,
and he brought them away and did so, so
well did he bear to be overlooked.</p>

<p>2. And if among the vulgar discourse
should arise concerning some maxim of thy
philosophy, do thou, for the most part, keep
silence, for there is great risk that thou
straightway vomit up what thou hast not
digested. And when some one shall say to
thee, <i>Thou knowest naught</i>, and it bites thee
not, then know that thou hast begun the
work.</p>

<p>3. And as sheep do not bring their food to
the shepherds to show how much they have
eaten, but digesting inwardly their provender,
bear outwardly wool and milk, even
so do not thou, for the most part, display
the maxims before the vulgar, but rather the
works which follow from them when they
are digested.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">ascesis.</span></h4>

<p>When you have adapted the body to a frugal
way of living, do not flatter yourself on that,
nor if you drink only water, say, on every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
opportunity, <i>I drink only water</i>. And if you
desire at any time to inure yourself to labor
and endurance, do it to yourself and not
unto the world. And do not embrace the
statues; but some time when you are exceedingly
thirsty take a mouthful of cold
water, and spit it out, and say nothing about
it.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">tokens.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> position and token of the vulgar:
he looks never to himself for benefit or hurt,
but always to outward things. The position
and character of the philosopher: he
looks for benefit or hurt only to himself.</p>

<p>2. The tokens of one that is making advance:
he blames none, he praises none,
he accuses none, he complains of none; he
speaks never of himself, as being somewhat,
or as knowing aught. When he is thwarted
or hindered in aught, he accuseth himself.
If one should praise him, he laughs at him
in his sleeve; if one should blame him, he
makes no defense. He goes about like the
sick and feeble, fearing to move the parts that
are settling together before they have taken
hold. He hath taken out of himself all
pursuit, and hath turned all avoidance to
things in our power which are contrary to
nature. Toward all things he will keep his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
inclination slack. If he is thought foolish
or unlearned, he regardeth it not. In a
word, he watches himself as he would a
treacherous enemy.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">that the logical art is necessary.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Since</span> Reason is that by which all other
things are organized and perfected,<a name="FNanchor_1_117" id="FNanchor_1_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_117" class="fnanchor">1</a> it is
meet that itself should not remain unorganized.
But by what shall it be organized?
For it is clear that this must be either by
itself or by some other thing. But this
must be Reason; or something else which
is greater than Reason, which is impossible.</p>

<p>2. &#8220;Yea,&#8221; one may say, &#8220;but it is more
pressing to cure our vices, and the like.&#8221;</p>

<p>You desire, then, to hear something of
these things? Hear then; but if you shall
say to me, <i>I know not if you are reasoning
truly or falsely?</i> or if I utter something ambiguous,
and you shall bid me distinguish,
shall I lose patience with you and tell you,
<i>It is more pressing to cure our vices than chop
logic</i>?</p>

<p>3. For this reason I think the logical are
set at the beginning of our study, even as
before the measuring of corn we set the
examination of the measure. For unless we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
shall first establish what is a modius<a name="FNanchor_2_118" id="FNanchor_2_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_118" class="fnanchor">2</a> and
what is a balance, how shall we be able to
measure or weigh anything?</p>

<p>4. In this case, then, if you have not understood
and accurately investigated the
criterion of all other things, and that through
which they are understood, shall we be able
to investigate and understand anything else?
and how could we? <i>Yea, but a modius is a
wooden thing, and barren.</i> But it measures
corn. <i>And logic is also barren.</i> As regards
this, indeed, we shall see. But even if one
should grant this, it sufficeth that logic is
that which distinguishes and investigates
other things, and, as one may say, measures
and weighs them. Who saith these things? is
it Chrysippus alone and Zeno and Cleanthes?
but doth not Antisthenes<a name="FNanchor_3_119" id="FNanchor_3_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_119" class="fnanchor">3</a> say it? And who
wrote that the investigation of terms is the
beginning of education?&mdash;was it not Socrates?
and of whom doth Xenophon write
that he began with the investigation of terms,
what each of them signified?</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">grammarian or sage.</span></h4>

<p>When some one may exalt himself in that
he is able to understand and expound the
works of Chrysippus, say then to thyself:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
If Chrysippus had not written obscurely,
this man would have had nothing whereon
to exalt himself. But I, what do I desire?
Is it not to learn to understand Nature and
to follow her? I inquire, then, who can
expound Nature to me, and hearing that
Chrysippus can, I betake myself to him.
But I do not understand his writings, therefore
I seek an expounder for them. And so
far there is nothing exalted. But when I
have found the expounder, it remaineth for
me to put in practice what he declares to
me, and in this alone is there anything exalted.
But if I shall admire the bare exposition,
what else have I made of myself
than a grammarian instead of a philosopher,
save, indeed, that the exposition is of Chrysippus
and not of Homer? When, therefore,
one may ask me to lecture on the philosophy
of Chrysippus, I shall rather blush
when I am not able to show forth works
of a like nature and in harmony with the
words.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">ACCOMPLISHMENTS.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> clearer be the characters in which
a book is writ, the more pleasantly and conveniently
shall any man read it. Thus also
a man shall listen more conveniently to any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
discourse if it be conveyed in well-ordered
and graceful words. Be it not said, then,
that there is no faculty of expression, for
this is the thought of a man both impious
and cowardly<a name="FNanchor_1_120" id="FNanchor_1_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_120" class="fnanchor">1</a>&mdash;impious, for he holds in
disesteem the gracious gifts of God, as if he
would take away the serviceable faculty of
seeing, or of hearing, or indeed this of speaking.
Did God give the eyes for nothing?
And was it for nothing that He mingled in
them a spirit of such might and cunning as
to reach a long way off and receive the impression
of visible forms&mdash;a messenger so
swift and faithful? Was it for nothing that
He gave the intervening air such efficacy,
and made it elastic, so that being, in a
manner, strained,<a name="FNanchor_2_121" id="FNanchor_2_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_121" class="fnanchor">2</a> our vision should traverse
it? Was it for nothing that He made Light,
without which there were no benefit of any
other thing?</p>

<p>2. Man, be not unthankful for these things,
nor yet unmindful of better things. For seeing
and hearing, and, by Zeus, for life itself,
and the things that work together to maintain
it, for dried fruits, for wine, for oil, do
thou give thanks to God. But remember
that He hath given thee another thing which
is better than all these&mdash;that, namely, which
uses them, which approves them, which
taketh account of the worth of each. For
what is that which declareth concerning all
these faculties how much each of them is
worth? Is it the faculty itself? Heard you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
ever the faculty of vision tell aught concerning
itself? or that of hearing? or wheat,
or barley, or a horse, or a dog? Nay, but
as ministers and slaves are they appointed,
to serve the faculty which makes use of appearances.
And if you would learn how
much any of them is worth, of whom will
you inquire? who shall give answer? How
then shall any other faculty be greater than
this, which both useth the others as its
servants, and the same approveth each of
them and declareth concerning them? For
which of them knoweth what itself is, and
what it is worth? Which of them knoweth
when it behooves to make use of it, and when
not? What is that which openeth and
closeth the eyes, turning them away from
things which they should not behold, and
guiding them towards other things? Is it
the faculty of vision? Nay, but the faculty
of the Will. What is that which closeth and
openeth the ears?&mdash;that in obedience to
which they become busy and curious, or
again, unmoved by what they hear? Is it
the faculty of hearing? It is no other than
that of the Will.</p>

<p>3. Being then so great a faculty, and set
over all the rest, let it come to us and tell
us that the best of existing things is the flesh!
Not even if the flesh itself affirmed that it
was the best, would any man have patience
with it. Now what is it, Epicurus, which
declares this doctrine, that the flesh is best,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
which wrote concerning the <i>End of Being</i>,
and on <i>Laws of Nature</i>, and on the <i>Canon of
Truth</i>?&mdash;which let thy beard grow? which
wrote, when dying, that it was spending its
last day and a happy one?<a name="FNanchor_3_122" id="FNanchor_3_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_122" class="fnanchor">3</a> Is it the flesh
or the Will? Wilt thou affirm, then, that
thou hast aught better than the Will? Nay,
but art thou not mad&mdash;so blind, in truth,
and deaf as thou art?</p>

<p>4. What then? Shall any man contemn
the other faculties? God forbid! Doth any
man say that there is no use or eminence in
the faculty of eloquence? God forbid&mdash;that
were senseless, impious, thankless towards
God. But to each thing its true worth.
For there is a certain use in an ass, but not
so much as in an ox; and in a dog, but not
so much as in a slave; and in a slave, but not
so much as in a citizen; and in citizens, but
not so much as in governors. Yet not because
other things are better is the use which
anything affords to be contemned. There
is a certain worth in the faculty of eloquence,
but not so much as in the Will. When, then,
I speak thus, let no man deem that I would
have you neglect the power of eloquence,
for I would not have you neglect your eyes,
or ears, or hands, or feet, or raiment, or
shoes. But if one ask me which is, then,
the best of existing things, what shall I say?
The faculty of eloquence I cannot say, but
that of the Will, when it is made right. For
this is that which useth the other, and all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
the other faculties, both small and great.
When this is set right, a man that was not
good becomes good; when it is not right, the
man becomes evil. This is that whereby we
fail or prosper&mdash;whereby we blame others,
or approve them; the neglect of which is
the misery, and the care of it the happiness,
of mankind.</p>

<p>5. But to take away the faculty of eloquence,
and to say that there is in truth no
such faculty, is not only the part of a thankless
man toward Him who hath given it, but
also of a cowardly. For such a one seemeth
to me to fear lest if there be any faculty of
this kind we shall not be able to despise it.
Such are they also which say that there is
no difference between beauty and ugliness.
Then were a man to be affected in like manner
on seeing Thersites and Achilles, or on
seeing Helen and any common woman?<a name="FNanchor_4_123" id="FNanchor_4_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_123" class="fnanchor">4</a>
Truly, a thought of fools and boors, and of
men who know not the nature of each thing,
but fear lest, if one perceive the difference,
he shall be straightway swept away and
overpowered by it. But the great thing is
this&mdash;to leave to each the faculty that it hath,
and so leaving it to scan the worth of the
faculty, and to learn what is the greatest of
existing things; and everywhere to pursue
this, and be zealous about this, making all
other things accessory to this, albeit, according
to our powers, not neglecting even these.
For of the eyes also must we take care, yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
not as of the best thing; yet of these, too,
by the very exercise of the best thing; since
that shall in no other wise subsist according
to Nature save by wise dealing in these
matters, and preferring certain things to
others.</p>

<p>6. But what is done in the world? As if
a man journeying to his own country should
pass by an excellent inn, and the inn being
agreeable to him, should stay, and abide in
it. Man, thou hast forgotten thy purpose;
thy journeying was not to this, but through
this. <i>But this is pleasant.</i> And how many
other inns are pleasant, and how many meadows?
yet merely for passing through. But
thy business is this, to arrive in thy native
country, to remove the fears of thy kinsfolk,
to do, thyself, the duties of a citizen, to
marry, to beget children, to fill the customary
offices. For thou art not come into
this world to choose out its pleasanter places,
but to dwell in those where thou wast born,
and whereof thou wast appointed to be a
citizen. And so in some wise it is with
this matter. Since, by the aid of speech and
such like deliverance, we must come to our
aim, and purify the Will, and order aright
the faculty which makes use of appearances;
and it is necessary that this deliverance of
the doctrines come to pass by a certain use
of speech, and with a certain art and trenchancy
of expression, there are some which
are taken captive by these things themselves,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
and abide in them&mdash;one in the gift of speech,
one in syllogisms, one in sophisms, one in
some such another of these inns, and there
they linger and molder away, as though
they were fallen among the Sirens.</p>

<p>7. Man, thy business was to make thyself
fit to use the appearances that encounter
thee according to Nature, not missing what
thou pursuest, nor falling into what thou
wouldst avoid, never failing of good fortune,
nor overtaken of ill fortune, free, unhindered,
uncompelled, agreeing with the governance
of Zeus, obedient unto the same, and well-pleased
therein; blaming none, charging
none, able of thy whole soul to utter these
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Lead me, O Zeus, and thou, Destiny!&#8221;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, having this for thy business, if some
little matter of eloquence please thee, or
certain speculations, wilt thou stay and
abide in them, and elect to settle in them,
forgetting all that is at home? and wilt thou
say, <i>These things are admirable</i>? Who saith
they are not admirable? but for passing
through, like inns. What should hinder one
that spoke like Demosthenes to be unfortunate?
or one that could resolve syllogisms
like Chrysippus to be miserable, to grieve,
to envy; in a word, to be troubled and unhappy?
Nothing. Thou seest now that all
these things are but inns, and of no worth;
but our business was another thing. When
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
I say these things to certain persons, they
think I am rejecting all care about language
or speculation. But I do not reject this; I
reject the endless occupation with them, the
putting our hopes in them. If a man by this
teaching injureth those who hear him, reckon
me also among those who do this injury.
For I cannot, in order to please you, see
that one thing is best and chief of all, and
say that another is.<a name="FNanchor_5_124" id="FNanchor_5_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_124" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">constancy.</span></h4>

<p>Abide in the precepts as in laws which it
were impious to transgress. And whatsoever
any man may say of thee, regard it
not; for neither is this anything of thine
own.</p>

<h3><br />CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">how long?</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">How</span> long wilt thou delay to hold thyself
worthy of the best things, and to transgress
in nothing the decrees of Reason?
Thou hast received the maxims by which it
behooves thee to live; and dost thou live by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
them? What teacher dost thou still look for
to whom to hand over the task of thy correction?
Thou art no longer a boy, but already
a man full grown. If, then, thou art neglectful
and sluggish, and ever making resolve
after resolve, and fixing one day after
another on which thou wilt begin to attend
to thyself, thou wilt forget that thou art
making no advance, but wilt go on as one
of the vulgar sort, both living and dying.</p>

<p>2. Now, at last, therefore hold thyself
worthy to live as a man of full age and one
who is pressing forward, and let everything
that appeareth the best be to thee as an inviolable
law. And if any toil or pleasure or
reputation or the loss of it be laid upon thee,
remember that now is the contest, here
already are the Olympian games, and there
is no deferring them any longer, and that in
a single day and in a single trial ground is
to be lost or gained.</p>

<p>3. It was thus that Socrates made himself
what he was, in all things that befell him
having regard to no other thing than Reason.
But thou, albeit thou be yet no Socrates,
yet as one that would be Socrates, so it behooveth
thee to live.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">parts of philosophy.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The</span> first and most necessary point in
philosophy is the use of the precepts, for
example, not to lie. The second is the proof
of these, as, Whence it comes that it is
wrong to lie? The third is that which giveth
confirmation and coherence to the others,
such as, Whence it comes that this is proof?
for what is proof? what is consequence?
what is contradiction? what is truth? what
is falsehood?</p>

<p>2. Thus the third point is necessary through
the second, and the second through the first.
But the most necessary of all, and that when
we should rest, is the first, But we do the
contrary. For we linger on the third point,
and spend all our zeal on that, while of the
first we are utterly neglectful, and thus we
are liars; but the explanation of how it is
shown to be wrong to lie we have ever ready
to hand.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_24" id="Footnote_1_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_24" class="FNanchor">1.</a> The founder of the Cynic school was Antisthenes,
who taught in the gymnasium named the Cynosarges,
at Athens; whence the name of his school. Zeller
takes this striking chapter to exhibit Epictetus&#8217;s
&#8220;philosophisches Ideal,&#8221; the Cynic being the &#8220;wahrer
Philosoph,&#8221; or perfect Stoic. (Phil. d. Gr. iii. S. 752.)
This view seems to me no more true than that the
missionary or monk is to be considered the ideal Christian.
Epictetus takes pains to make it clear that the
Cynic is a Stoic with a special and separate vocation,
which all Stoics are by no means called upon to take
up. Like Thoreau, that modern Stoic, when he went
to live at Walden, the Cynic tries the extreme of abnegation
in order to demonstrate practically that man has
resources within himself which make him equal to any
fate that circumstances can inflict.</p></div>

(Schw.), refers to various passages in Epictetus where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
pity and envy are mentioned together as though they
were related emotions, and aptly quotes Virgil (<i>Georg.</i>
ii. 499):&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Aut doluit miserans inopem, aut invidit habenti.&#8221;</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>
It will be clear to any careful reader that when Epictetus
asserts that certain emotions or acts are unworthy
of a man, he constantly means the &#8220;man&#8221; to be understood
as his highest spiritual faculty, his deepest sense
of reason, his soul. That we are not to pity or grieve
means that that side of us which is related to the divine
and eternal is not to be affected by emotions produced
by calamities in mere outward and material things.
St. Augustine corroborates this view in an interesting
passage bearing on the Stoic doctrine of pity (<i>De Civ.
Dei.</i> ix. 5; <i>Schw.</i> iv. 132):&mdash;
</p><p>
&#8220;Misericordiam Cicero non dubitavit appellare virtutem,
quam Stoicos inter vitia numerare non pudet, qui
tamen, ut docuit liber Epicteti nobilissimi Stoici ex
decretis Zenonis et Chrysippi, qui hujus sect&aelig; primas
partes habuerunt, hujuscemodi passiones in animum
Sapientis admittunt, quem vitiis omnibus liberam esse
volunt. Unde fit consequens, ut h&aelig;c ipsa non putent
vitia, quando Sapienti sic accidunt, ut contra virtutem
mentis rationemque nihil possunt.&#8221;
</p><p>
The particular utterances of Epictetus here alluded
to by St. Augustine must have been contained in some
of the lost books of the <i>Dissertations</i>, as nothing like
them is to be found explicitly in those which survive,
although the latter afford us abundant means for
deducing the conclusion which St. Augustine confirms.</p></div>

But it appears to have been a vexed question in antiquity
whether an ascetic philosopher might indulge in
this particular luxury (&#960;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#8166;&#962;). Upton quotes Lucian
and Diogenes Laertius for instances of this question
being propounded, and an affirmative answer given (in
one instance by the Cynic, Diogenes). The youth in
the text is being addressed as a novice who must not

and valuable note communicated to Upton, the
&#8220;master-argument&#8221; was so called from the supreme
importance of the issues with which it dealt. On these
issues different leaders of the Stoics took different sides,
Diodorus holding both future and past things to be
<i>necessary</i>, Cleanthes both <i>contingent</i>, and Chrysippus
past things to be necessary and future contingent. Any
two of the three propositions mentioned in the text
exclude the third. For modern philosophy the distinction
between the possible and the certain in the
phenomenal world has, of course, no real existence;
the possible being simply that of which we do not know
whether it will come to pass or not.</p></div>

The philosopher has no need of such exhortation, for
he does not complain, and as for death, is content to
wait God&#8217;s time. But the Stoics taught that the arrival
of this time might be indicated by some disaster or
affliction which rendered a natural and wholesome
life impossible. Self-destruction was in such cases
permissible, and is recorded to have been adopted by
several leaders of the Stoics, generally when old age
had begun to render them a burden to their friends.</p></div>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
look pale and anxious, though not indeed showing the
signs of panic exhibited by the other passengers.

feebleness in his professed faith, the Stoic produced
the Fifth Book of Epictetus, and read this passage.</p></div>

is obscure. At one time the &#8220;appearances,&#8221; &#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#8055;&#945;&#953;,
are compared to the ray of light; at another, the doctrines
(literally &#8220;arts,&#8221; <i>i. e.</i>, arts of life taught by philosophy)
and virtues. Probably the explanation is to be
found in the view of the Stoics that at birth the human
soul is a <i>tabula rasa</i>, or blank sheet; all our knowledge
coming from without; that is, from the &#8220;appearances&#8221;

personal revelation of God, some supernatural manifestation
of His existence and care for men, is noted by
Zeller as a special trait of Hellenistic times. Such a
revelation must have been longed for by many as the
only satisfying answer to the destructive logic of the
Pyrrhonists, and men&#8217;s minds were also of course led
that way by the insistence of the Stoic thinkers upon
the communion of the individual with God, as the
most important of all possible relations. Hence the
growth of many wild and orgiastic cults at this epoch&mdash;all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
based on the state of ecstasy connected with their
rites, which was ascribed to supernatural influence.
With the Stoics this movement took the comparatively
sober shape of attention to the established system of
oracular divination. Zeller, however, shows that some
Stoics were disposed to rationalize the revelations of
the oracles by supposing a certain sympathy between
the mind of the seer and the future events which led
to the unconscious selection of means of divination
which would exhibit the proper signs.&mdash;(Z. 339, 340.)
Epictetus evidently thought more of God&#8217;s revelation
in the conscience than any other.</p></div>

because to call God to witness in any merely personal

of the nature of the Good in it. He may be mistaken
in this; but so long as he does not know where
Good and Evil really lie, he can do no other than he

acquired by the uninstructed and feeble there is danger

<h4>NOTES ON PRINCIPAL PHILOSOPHIC TERMS USED BY EPICTETUS.</h4>

<p>[I give under this head only those terms the exact force of which may
not be apparent to the reader in a mere translation.]</p>

<p class="indent">&#913;&#7984;&#948;&#8053;&#956;&#969;&#957;.&mdash;Pious, reverent, modest. The substantive is &#945;&#7984;&#948;&#8061;&#962;, the German
Ehrfurcht (<i>Wilhelm Meister</i>, <i>Wanderjahre</i>, Bk. II. ch. ii.), a virtue
in high regard with Epictetus, who generally mentions it in connection
with that of &#8220;faithfulness,&#8221; &#960;&#8055;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;. In Wordsworth&#8217;s poem, &#8220;My heart
leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky,&#8221; the &#8220;natural piety&#8221; which
he prays may abide with him in his old age seems to be just that moral
sensitiveness or &#945;&#7984;&#948;&#8061;&#962; which passes into reverence and worship in the
presence of certain things, and into shame and dread in that of others.</p>

<p class="indent">&#7944;&#960;&#8049;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;.&mdash;Peace&mdash;that is, peace from passion, &#960;&#8049;&#952;&#951;. &#928;&#8049;&#952;&#959;&#962; was any
affection of the mind causing joy or grief. As it appears from Bk. II.
iii. I., &#7936;&#960;&#8049;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945; is not, in Epictetus, the state of absolute freedom
from these passions, but that of being able to master them so that they
shall not overwhelm the inner man.</p>

<p class="indent">&#916;&#953;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8057;&#962;.&mdash;That which <i>organizes</i>, constitutes organically, forms
into a system. From ἄρθρον, a joint. The word &#8220;analyze,&#8221; by which Long
translates &#948;&#953;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#957;, seems to me wanting in the formative sense
expressed by the original.</p>

<p class="indent">&#916;&#8057;&#947;&#956;&#945;.&mdash;An opinion, that which seems (&#948;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;) true; generally in the
special sense of a philosophic dogma.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">&#7960;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#949;&#8150;&#957;.&mdash;To prosper; literally, to flow freely, &#949;&#8020;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#945;, prosperity. A
common Stoic phrase for a happy life.</p>

<p class="indent">&#917;&#8016;&#963;&#8051;&#946;&#949;&#953;&#945;.&mdash;Religion, piety. &#963;&#8051;&#946;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;&mdash;&#8220;<i>to feel awe</i> or <i>fear</i> before God
and man, especially when about to do something disgraceful&#8221; (<i>Liddell
and Scott</i>); to worship, respect, reverence.</p>

<p class="indent">&#7977;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8057;&#957; (&#964;&#8057;).&mdash;The Ruling Faculty&mdash;that in a man which chooses,
determines, takes cognizance of good and evil, and sways the inferior
faculties (&#948;&#965;&#957;&#8049;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#962;, powers) to its will. Lotze notes this <i>hegemonic</i>
quality in the human soul as that which distinguishes it from the bundle
of sensations into which the Association Philosophy would resolve it.</p>

<p class="indent">&#952;&#945;&#965;&#956;&#8049;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;.&mdash;To admire, be dazzled with admiration by, to worship, to be
taken up with a thing so as to lose the power of cool judgment. A
frequent word in Epictetus, the sense of which is precisely rendered in
Hor. <i>Sat.</i> I, 4, 28, &#8220;Hunc capit argenti splendor, <i>stupet</i> Albius
&aelig;re.&#8221;</p>

<p class="indent">&#7992;&#948;&#953;&#8061;&#964;&#951;&#962;.&mdash;One of the vulgar, an unlettered person; in Epictetus, one
uninstructed in philosophy. Originally the word meant one who remained
in private life, not filling any public office, or taking part in State
affairs. A man might be an &#7984;&#948;&#953;&#8061;&#964;&#951;&#962;, or &#8220;layman,&#8221; with respect to any
branch of science or art.</p>

<p class="indent">&#922;&#945;&#955;&#8056;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8057;&#962;.&mdash;The good and wise man&mdash;literally, beautiful and good.
A standing phrase to denote the perfection of human character. &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8056;&#962; is
a word sometimes difficult to render. Curtius connects it etymologically
with Sanscrit, <i>kalyas</i>; Gothic, <i>hails</i>=healthy.</p>

<p class="indent">&#927;&#7988;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;.&mdash;&#8220;Conceit&#8221;&mdash;defined by Cicero as &#8220;Opinatio&#8221;&mdash;intellectual
self-sufficiency, the supposing one&#8217;s self to know something when one
does not. &#8220;The first business
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
of a philosopher,&#8221; says Epictetus, &#8220;is to
cast away o&#7988;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, for it is impossible that one can begin to learn the
things that he thinks he knows&#8221; (<i>Diss.</i> II. xvii. 1.) He is not, in
short, to be &#8220;wise in his own conceit.&#8221;</p>

<p class="indent">&#8004;&#961;&#949;&#958;&#953;&#962;, &#7956;&#954;&#954;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#962;, &#8001;&#961;&#956;&#8053;, &#7936;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#956;&#8053;.&mdash;Pursuit, avoidance, desire, aversion.
According to Simplicius (Comment. <i>Ench.</i> i.), &#8004;&#961;&#949;&#958;&#953;&#962; and &#7956;&#954;&#954;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#962; were
used by the Stoics to express the counterparts in outward action of the
mental affections, &#8001;&#961;&#956;&#8052; and &#7936;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#956;&#8053;, and were regarded as consequent upon
the latter.</p>

<p class="indent">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#8055;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;.&mdash;The Will; but as used in Epictetus, this word implies much
more than the mere faculty of volition. Literally, it means a choosing
of one thing before another; in Epictetus, the power of deliberately
resolving or purposing, the exercise of the reflective faculty being
implied. It is hardly to be distinguished from &#964;&#8056; &#7969;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8057;&#957;, <i>q. v.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#955;&#8053;&#968;&#949;&#953;&#962;.&mdash;&#8220;Natural Conceptions.&#8221; See Preface, xxviii., xxix. The
&#8220;primary truths&#8221; of Lord Herbert of Cherbury.</p>

<p class="indent">&#931;&#965;&#947;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#8055;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;.&mdash;To assent to or acquiesce in anything, to ratify by
the judgment the emotions produced by external things or events, such as
the sense of dread, or pleasure, or reprobation, which they arouse in
us. To be on one&#8217;s guard against the hasty yielding of this assent is
one of Epictetus&#8217;s main injunctions to the aspirant in philosophy.</p>

<p class="indent">&#932;&#945;&#961;&#8049;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;.&mdash;To be troubled; &#7936;-&#964;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#958;&#8055;&#945;, tranquillity. &#932;&#945;&#961;&#8049;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#957; is
primarily to stir up, confuse, throw into disorder.</p>

<p class="indent">&#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#8055;&#945;.&mdash;An appearance; with the Stoics, any mental impression as
received by the perceptive faculty before the Reason has pronounced upon
it, a bare perception.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
